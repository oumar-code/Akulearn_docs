Food and water (most important)\n2. Clothing and shelter\n3. Education and healthcare\n4. Entertainment and luxury items\n\n**Example 3: Production Possibility Curve**\nWith limited resources, a farmer can produce:\n- 10 bags rice OR 20 bags maize\n- 5 bags rice AND 10 bags maize\n- Shows trade-offs and efficiency\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- Economics is only about money\n- Rich people don't face scarcity\n- Government can solve all economic problems\n- Economic growth benefits everyone equally\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Personal financial planning and budgeting\n- Business decision-making and resource allocation\n- Government policy and economic planning\n- International trade and globalization\n- Environmental resource management\n- Career planning and salary negotiations\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Distinguish between needs and wants with examples\n2. Explain why scarcity forces choice\n3. List 4 factors of production\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Calculate opportunity cost in a budget decision\n5. Construct a simple scale of preference\n6. Explain division of labor in a factory\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Analyze production possibility curve shifts\n8. Evaluate economic impact of government policies\n9. Apply economic principles to real-world problems\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Basic economic concepts and definitions\n- Scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost\n- Needs vs wants, goods vs services\n- Factors of production\n\n### Study Tips\n- Relate concepts to daily life experiences\n- Create personal budget examples\n- Study current economic news\n- Practice with real-world scenarios\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Economics textbooks for secondary schools\n- BBC Economics resources\n- Khan Academy: Microeconomics\n- Financial planning websites\n        ",

Food and water (most important)\n2. Clothing and shelter\n3. Education and healthcare\n4. Entertainment and luxury items\n\n**Example 3: Production Possibility Curve**\nWith limited resources, a farmer can produce:\n- 10 bags rice OR 20 bags maize\n- 5 bags rice AND 10 bags maize\n- Shows trade-offs and efficiency\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- Economics is only about money\n- Rich people don't face scarcity\n- Government can solve all economic problems\n- Economic growth benefits everyone equally\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Personal financial planning and budgeting\n- Business decision-making and resource allocation\n- Government policy and economic planning\n- International trade and globalization\n- Environmental resource management\n- Career planning and salary negotiations\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Distinguish between needs and wants with examples\n2. Explain why scarcity forces choice\n3. List 4 factors of production\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Calculate opportunity cost in a budget decision\n5. Construct a simple scale of preference\n6. Explain division of labor in a factory\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Analyze production possibility curve shifts\n8. Evaluate economic impact of government policies\n9. Apply economic principles to real-world problems\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Basic economic concepts and definitions\n- Scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost\n- Needs vs wants, goods vs services\n- Factors of production\n\n### Study Tips\n- Relate concepts to daily life experiences\n- Create personal budget examples\n- Study current economic news\n- Practice with real-world scenarios\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Economics textbooks for secondary schools\n- BBC Economics resources\n- Khan Academy: Microeconomics\n- Financial planning websites\n        ",
