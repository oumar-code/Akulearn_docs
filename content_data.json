Food and water (most important)\n2. Clothing and shelter\n3. Education and healthcare\n4. Entertainment and luxury items\n\n**Example 3: Production Possibility Curve**\nWith limited resources, a farmer can produce:\n- 10 bags rice OR 20 bags maize\n- 5 bags rice AND 10 bags maize\n- Shows trade-offs and efficiency\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- Economics is only about money\n- Rich people don't face scarcity\n- Government can solve all economic problems\n- Economic growth benefits everyone equally\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Personal financial planning and budgeting\n- Business decision-making and resource allocation\n- Government policy and economic planning\n- International trade and globalization\n- Environmental resource management\n- Career planning and salary negotiations\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Distinguish between needs and wants with examples\n2. Explain why scarcity forces choice\n3. List 4 factors of production\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Calculate opportunity cost in a budget decision\n5. Construct a simple scale of preference\n6. Explain division of labor in a factory\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Analyze production possibility curve shifts\n8. Evaluate economic impact of government policies\n9. Apply economic principles to real-world problems\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Basic economic concepts and definitions\n- Scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost\n- Needs vs wants, goods vs services\n- Factors of production\n\n### Study Tips\n- Relate concepts to daily life experiences\n- Create personal budget examples\n- Study current economic news\n- Practice with real-world scenarios\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Economics textbooks for secondary schools\n- BBC Economics resources\n- Khan Academy: Microeconomics\n- Financial planning websites\n        ",

      "content": "\n## 💰 Basic Economic Concepts and Principles\n\n### Core Concepts\nEconomics is the study of how individuals and societies allocate scarce resources.\n\n**Fundamental Concepts:**\n- **Scarcity**: Limited resources, unlimited wants\n- **Choice**: Decision-making due to scarcity\n- **Opportunity Cost**: Value of next best alternative forgone\n- **Scale of Preference**: Ranking of wants by importance\n\n**Needs vs Wants:**\n- **Needs**: Essential for survival (food, shelter, clothing)\n- **Wants**: Desirable but not essential items\n- **Goods**: Physical items (cars, phones, books)\n- **Services**: Non-physical benefits (haircut, teaching)\n\n**Production and Consumption:**\n- **Production**: Creation of goods and services\n- **Consumption**: Using goods and services to satisfy wants\n- **Factors of Production**: Land, Labor, Capital, Entrepreneurship\n- **Division of Labor**: Specialization in production\n\n### Worked Examples\n\n**Example 1: Opportunity Cost**\nA student has ₦500 and must choose between:\n- Movie ticket: ₦300\n- Textbook: ₦250\nIf chooses movie, opportunity cost is textbook (₦250)\nIf chooses textbook, opportunity cost is movie (₦300)\n\n**Example 2: Scale of Preference**\nStudent's wants ranked by priority:\n1. Food and water (most important)\n2. Clothing and shelter\n3. Education and healthcare\n4. Entertainment and luxury items\n\n**Example 3: Production Possibility Curve**\nWith limited resources, a farmer can produce:\n- 10 bags rice OR 20 bags maize\n- 5 bags rice AND 10 bags maize\n- Shows trade-offs and efficiency\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- Economics is only about money\n- Rich people don't face scarcity\n- Government can solve all economic problems\n- Economic growth benefits everyone equally\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Personal financial planning and budgeting\n- Business decision-making and resource allocation\n- Government policy and economic planning\n- International trade and globalization\n- Environmental resource management\n- Career planning and salary negotiations\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Distinguish between needs and wants with examples\n2. Explain why scarcity forces choice\n3. List 4 factors of production\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Calculate opportunity cost in a budget decision\n5. Construct a simple scale of preference\n6. Explain division of labor in a factory\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Analyze production possibility curve shifts\n8. Evaluate economic impact of government policies\n9. Apply economic principles to real-world problems\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Basic economic concepts and definitions\n- Scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost\n- Needs vs wants, goods vs services\n- Factors of production\n\n### Study Tips\n- Relate concepts to daily life experiences\n- Create personal budget examples\n- Study current economic news\n- Practice with real-world scenarios\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Economics textbooks for secondary schools\n- BBC Economics resources\n- Khan Academy: Microeconomics\n- Financial planning websites\n        ",

Find derivative of f(x) = x³ + 2x² - x + 1\n2. Evaluate limit: lim(x→2) (x² - 4)/(x - 2)\n3. Determine if f(x) = |x| is differentiable at x = 0\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Differentiate f(x) = (x² + 3)/(x - 1) using quotient rule\n5. Find equation of tangent line to y = x² at x = 2\n6. Solve optimization: Maximize profit P = 100x - x² - 50\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Find second derivative of f(x) = eˣ sin x\n8. Apply Rolle's theorem to f(x) = x³ - 3x on [-2, 2]\n9.

Explain natural selection with example\n2. Draw simple food chain\n3. Define biodiversity\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Compare Lamarckism vs Darwinism\n5. Analyze population growth curve\n6. Explain nitrogen cycle\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Discuss evidence for evolution\n8. Analyze ecosystem stability factors\n9. Design conservation strategy\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Theories of evolution\n- Natural selection mechanisms\n- Ecosystem components and interactions\n- Population ecology\n- Conservation biology\n\n### Study Tips\n- Create evolutionary timelines\n- Draw ecosystem diagrams\n- Understand mathematical models\n- Connect concepts to current issues\n\n### Additional Resources\n- HHMI: Evolution resources\n- National Geographic: Ecology\n- Textbook: Biology by Campbell\n- Online biodiversity databases\n        ",

Food and water (most important)\n2. Clothing and shelter\n3. Education and healthcare\n4. Entertainment and luxury items\n\n**Example 3: Production Possibility Curve**\nWith limited resources, a farmer can produce:\n- 10 bags rice OR 20 bags maize\n- 5 bags rice AND 10 bags maize\n- Shows trade-offs and efficiency\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- Economics is only about money\n- Rich people don't face scarcity\n- Government can solve all economic problems\n- Economic growth benefits everyone equally\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Personal financial planning and budgeting\n- Business decision-making and resource allocation\n- Government policy and economic planning\n- International trade and globalization\n- Environmental resource management\n- Career planning and salary negotiations\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Distinguish between needs and wants with examples\n2. Explain why scarcity forces choice\n3. List 4 factors of production\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Calculate opportunity cost in a budget decision\n5. Construct a simple scale of preference\n6. Explain division of labor in a factory\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Analyze production possibility curve shifts\n8. Evaluate economic impact of government policies\n9. Apply economic principles to real-world problems\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Basic economic concepts and definitions\n- Scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost\n- Needs vs wants, goods vs services\n- Factors of production\n\n### Study Tips\n- Relate concepts to daily life experiences\n- Create personal budget examples\n- Study current economic news\n- Practice with real-world scenarios\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Economics textbooks for secondary schools\n- BBC Economics resources\n- Khan Academy: Microeconomics\n- Financial planning websites\n        ",

Supply is the quantity producers are willing and able to sell at different prices.\n\n**Law of Demand:** As price increases, quantity demanded decreases (inverse relationship)\n\n**Law of Supply:** As price increases, quantity supplied increases (direct relationship)\n\n**Market Equilibrium:** Point where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied\n\n### Worked Examples\n\n**Example 1: Demand Schedule**\nPrice (₦) | Quantity Demanded\n100       | 20\n80        | 30\n60        | 50\n40        | 80\n\n**Example 2: Supply Schedule**\nPrice (₦) | Quantity Supplied\n100       | 80\n80        | 60\n60        | 40\n40        | 20\n\n**Example 3: Equilibrium Price**\nAt equilibrium: Qd = Qs = 50 units, Price = ₦60\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- Demand and quantity demanded mean the same thing\n- Supply and quantity supplied are identical\n- Price always equals equilibrium price\n- Demand curves always slope downward\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Pricing strategies in business\n- Government taxation and subsidy policies\n- Agricultural product pricing\n- Stock market analysis\n- Housing market dynamics\n- International trade negotiations\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Define demand and list 4 factors affecting it\n2. Explain the law of supply with an example\n3. Draw a simple demand curve\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Calculate equilibrium price from demand and supply schedules\n5. Explain how price changes affect market equilibrium\n6. Analyze impact of government intervention\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Apply demand-supply analysis to real market situations\n8. Evaluate price control effects on markets\n9. Analyze international trade using demand-supply model\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Laws of demand and supply\n- Factors affecting demand and supply\n- Market equilibrium and price determination\n- Applications to real-world situations\n\n### Study Tips\n- Create demand-supply diagrams for different scenarios\n- Study current market news and price changes\n- Practice calculating equilibrium points\n- Understand government market interventions\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Economics textbooks for secondary schools\n- BBC Economics: Markets\n- Khan Academy: Supply and Demand\n- Financial news websites\n        ",

It has two main branches: differential calculus (rates of change) and integral calculus (accumulation).\n\n**Differentiation:**\n- **Derivative**: Rate of change of a function\n- **Power Rule**: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)\n- **Product Rule**: d/dx(uv) = u'v + uv'\n- **Chain Rule**: d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) × g'(x)\n\n**Vectors:**\n- **Scalar**: Quantity with magnitude only\n- **Vector**: Quantity with magnitude and direction\n- **Vector Operations**: Addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication\n- **Dot Product**: u·v = |u||v|cosθ\n\n### Worked Examples\n\n**Example 1: Basic Differentiation**\nd/dx(x³) = 3x²\nd/dx(2x + 1) = 2\n\n**Example 2: Product Rule**\nd/dx(x² × sin(x)) = 2x × sin(x) + x² × cos(x)\n\n**Example 3: Vector Addition**\nIf u = (2, 3) and v = (1, 4)\nu + v = (3, 7)\n\n**Example 4: Dot Product**\nu = (3, 4), v = (1, 2)\nu·v = 3×1 + 4×2 = 11\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- Calculus is only for advanced mathematics\n- Vectors are just arrows on paper\n- Differentiation and integration are opposites\n- All functions have derivatives\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Physics: Motion, forces, and energy\n- Engineering: Design optimization and modeling\n- Economics: Marginal analysis and optimization\n- Computer graphics: 3D modeling and animation\n- Navigation: GPS and directional calculations\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Find derivative of x⁴\n2. Differentiate 3x² + 2x + 1\n3. Add vectors u = (1,2) and v = (3,4)\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Apply product rule to x³ × e^x\n5. Find dot product of (2,5) and (3,1)\n6. Differentiate using chain rule\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Solve optimization problems using derivatives\n8. Apply vectors to resolve forces\n9. Use calculus in real-world applications\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Basic differentiation rules\n- Vector operations in 2D\n- Applications of calculus\n- Problem-solving with vectors\n\n### Study Tips\n- Practice differentiation daily\n- Visualize vectors geometrically\n- Understand calculus applications\n- Work through real-world examples\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Calculus textbooks\n- Khan Academy: Calculus\n- MIT OpenCourseWare\n- Vector geometry software\n        ",

It includes all income earned by factors of production.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **GDP**: Gross Domestic Product - total value of goods and services produced within a country\n- **GNP**: Gross National Product - GDP plus net income from abroad\n- **NNP**: Net National Product - GNP minus depreciation\n- **NI**: National Income - NNP minus indirect taxes plus subsidies\n\n**Economic Growth:** Sustained increase in real GDP over time\n\n**Methods of Measurement:**\n- **Product Method**: Sum of value added at each stage\n- **Income Method**: Sum of all factor incomes\n- **Expenditure Method**: Total spending on final goods and services\n\n### Worked Examples\n\n**Example 1: Expenditure Method**\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere: C = Consumption, I = Investment, G = Government spending, X = Exports, M = Imports\n\n**Example 2: Income Method**\nNI = Wages + Rent + Interest + Profit + Mixed Income\n\n**Example 3: Real vs Nominal GDP**\nNominal GDP 2023: ₦100 trillion\nInflation: 10%\nReal GDP = ₦100 trillion / 1.10 = ₦90.91 trillion\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- GDP measures economic welfare completely\n- Economic growth always means development\n- All economic activities are included in GDP\n- Higher GDP always means better living standards\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Government budget planning and taxation\n- Economic policy formulation and evaluation\n- Business investment decisions\n- International economic comparisons\n- Development planning and aid allocation\n- Inflation and growth monitoring\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Define GDP and explain its importance\n2. List components of expenditure method\n3. Distinguish between real and nominal GDP\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Calculate GDP using expenditure method\n5. Explain factors affecting economic growth\n6. Analyze inflation effects on GDP\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Evaluate government economic policies\n8. Compare economic performance of countries\n9. Assess sustainable economic development\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Concepts of national income\n- Methods of measuring national income\n- Economic growth and development\n- Government economic policies\n\n### Study Tips\n- Study current economic data and statistics\n- Understand different GDP calculations\n- Learn about economic indicators\n- Analyze government economic reports\n\n### Additional Resources\n- National Bureau of Statistics reports\n- World Bank economic data\n- Economics textbooks\n- Financial news and analysis\n        ",

Find derivative of f(x) = x³ + 2x² - x + 1\n2. Evaluate limit: lim(x→2) (x² - 4)/(x - 2)\n3. Determine if f(x) = |x| is differentiable at x = 0\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Differentiate f(x) = (x² + 3)/(x - 1) using quotient rule\n5. Find equation of tangent line to y = x² at x = 2\n6. Solve optimization: Maximize profit P = 100x - x² - 50\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Find second derivative of f(x) = eˣ sin x\n8. Apply Rolle's theorem to f(x) = x³ - 3x on [-2, 2]\n9. Evaluate definite integral ∫(1 to 3) (2x + 1) dx\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Basic differentiation (power, product, quotient rules)\n- Limits and continuity concepts\n- Applications to maximum/minimum problems\n- Simple integration problems\n\n### Study Tips\n- Master basic differentiation rules before applications\n- Practice 50+ differentiation problems weekly\n- Understand geometric interpretation of derivatives\n- Use graphing calculators for visualization\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Khan Academy: Differential Calculus\n- YouTube: Professor Leonard (Calculus)\n- Textbook: Calculus by James Stewart\n- Wolfram Alpha for derivative calculations\n        ",

Food and water (most important)\n2. Clothing and shelter\n3. Education and healthcare\n4. Entertainment and luxury items\n\n**Example 3: Production Possibility Curve**\nWith limited resources, a farmer can produce:\n- 10 bags rice OR 20 bags maize\n- 5 bags rice AND 10 bags maize\n- Shows trade-offs and efficiency\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- Economics is only about money\n- Rich people don't face scarcity\n- Government can solve all economic problems\n- Economic growth benefits everyone equally\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Personal financial planning and budgeting\n- Business decision-making and resource allocation\n- Government policy and economic planning\n- International trade and globalization\n- Environmental resource management\n- Career planning and salary negotiations\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Distinguish between needs and wants with examples\n2. Explain why scarcity forces choice\n3. List 4 factors of production\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Calculate opportunity cost in a budget decision\n5. Construct a simple scale of preference\n6. Explain division of labor in a factory\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Analyze production possibility curve shifts\n8. Evaluate economic impact of government policies\n9. Apply economic principles to real-world problems\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Basic economic concepts and definitions\n- Scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost\n- Needs vs wants, goods vs services\n- Factors of production\n\n### Study Tips\n- Relate concepts to daily life experiences\n- Create personal budget examples\n- Study current economic news\n- Practice with real-world scenarios\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Economics textbooks for secondary schools\n- BBC Economics resources\n- Khan Academy: Microeconomics\n- Financial planning websites\n        ",

Supply is the quantity producers are willing and able to sell at different prices.\n\n**Law of Demand:** As price increases, quantity demanded decreases (inverse relationship)\n\n**Law of Supply:** As price increases, quantity supplied increases (direct relationship)\n\n**Market Equilibrium:** Point where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied\n\n### Worked Examples\n\n**Example 1: Demand Schedule**\nPrice (₦) | Quantity Demanded\n100       | 20\n80        | 30\n60        | 50\n40        | 80\n\n**Example 2: Supply Schedule**\nPrice (₦) | Quantity Supplied\n100       | 80\n80        | 60\n60        | 40\n40        | 20\n\n**Example 3: Equilibrium Price**\nAt equilibrium: Qd = Qs = 50 units, Price = ₦60\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- Demand and quantity demanded mean the same thing\n- Supply and quantity supplied are identical\n- Price always equals equilibrium price\n- Demand curves always slope downward\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Pricing strategies in business\n- Government taxation and subsidy policies\n- Agricultural product pricing\n- Stock market analysis\n- Housing market dynamics\n- International trade negotiations\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Define demand and list 4 factors affecting it\n2. Explain the law of supply with an example\n3. Draw a simple demand curve\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Calculate equilibrium price from demand and supply schedules\n5. Explain how price changes affect market equilibrium\n6. Analyze impact of government intervention\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Apply demand-supply analysis to real market situations\n8. Evaluate price control effects on markets\n9. Analyze international trade using demand-supply model\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Laws of demand and supply\n- Factors affecting demand and supply\n- Market equilibrium and price determination\n- Applications to real-world situations\n\n### Study Tips\n- Create demand-supply diagrams for different scenarios\n- Study current market news and price changes\n- Practice calculating equilibrium points\n- Understand government market interventions\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Economics textbooks for secondary schools\n- BBC Economics: Markets\n- Khan Academy: Supply and Demand\n- Financial news websites\n        ",

It has two main branches: differential calculus (rates of change) and integral calculus (accumulation).\n\n**Differentiation:**\n- **Derivative**: Rate of change of a function\n- **Power Rule**: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)\n- **Product Rule**: d/dx(uv) = u'v + uv'\n- **Chain Rule**: d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) × g'(x)\n\n**Vectors:**\n- **Scalar**: Quantity with magnitude only\n- **Vector**: Quantity with magnitude and direction\n- **Vector Operations**: Addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication\n- **Dot Product**: u·v = |u||v|cosθ\n\n### Worked Examples\n\n**Example 1: Basic Differentiation**\nd/dx(x³) = 3x²\nd/dx(2x + 1) = 2\n\n**Example 2: Product Rule**\nd/dx(x² × sin(x)) = 2x × sin(x) + x² × cos(x)\n\n**Example 3: Vector Addition**\nIf u = (2, 3) and v = (1, 4)\nu + v = (3, 7)\n\n**Example 4: Dot Product**\nu = (3, 4), v = (1, 2)\nu·v = 3×1 + 4×2 = 11\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- Calculus is only for advanced mathematics\n- Vectors are just arrows on paper\n- Differentiation and integration are opposites\n- All functions have derivatives\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Physics: Motion, forces, and energy\n- Engineering: Design optimization and modeling\n- Economics: Marginal analysis and optimization\n- Computer graphics: 3D modeling and animation\n- Navigation: GPS and directional calculations\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Find derivative of x⁴\n2. Differentiate 3x² + 2x + 1\n3. Add vectors u = (1,2) and v = (3,4)\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Apply product rule to x³ × e^x\n5. Find dot product of (2,5) and (3,1)\n6. Differentiate using chain rule\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Solve optimization problems using derivatives\n8. Apply vectors to resolve forces\n9. Use calculus in real-world applications\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Basic differentiation rules\n- Vector operations in 2D\n- Applications of calculus\n- Problem-solving with vectors\n\n### Study Tips\n- Practice differentiation daily\n- Visualize vectors geometrically\n- Understand calculus applications\n- Work through real-world examples\n\n### Additional Resources\n- Calculus textbooks\n- Khan Academy: Calculus\n- MIT OpenCourseWare\n- Vector geometry software\n        ",

It includes all income earned by factors of production.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **GDP**: Gross Domestic Product - total value of goods and services produced within a country\n- **GNP**: Gross National Product - GDP plus net income from abroad\n- **NNP**: Net National Product - GNP minus depreciation\n- **NI**: National Income - NNP minus indirect taxes plus subsidies\n\n**Economic Growth:** Sustained increase in real GDP over time\n\n**Methods of Measurement:**\n- **Product Method**: Sum of value added at each stage\n- **Income Method**: Sum of all factor incomes\n- **Expenditure Method**: Total spending on final goods and services\n\n### Worked Examples\n\n**Example 1: Expenditure Method**\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere: C = Consumption, I = Investment, G = Government spending, X = Exports, M = Imports\n\n**Example 2: Income Method**\nNI = Wages + Rent + Interest + Profit + Mixed Income\n\n**Example 3: Real vs Nominal GDP**\nNominal GDP 2023: ₦100 trillion\nInflation: 10%\nReal GDP = ₦100 trillion / 1.10 = ₦90.91 trillion\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n- GDP measures economic welfare completely\n- Economic growth always means development\n- All economic activities are included in GDP\n- Higher GDP always means better living standards\n\n### Real-Life Applications\n- Government budget planning and taxation\n- Economic policy formulation and evaluation\n- Business investment decisions\n- International economic comparisons\n- Development planning and aid allocation\n- Inflation and growth monitoring\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n**Basic Level:**\n1. Define GDP and explain its importance\n2. List components of expenditure method\n3. Distinguish between real and nominal GDP\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n4. Calculate GDP using expenditure method\n5. Explain factors affecting economic growth\n6. Analyze inflation effects on GDP\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n7. Evaluate government economic policies\n8. Compare economic performance of countries\n9. Assess sustainable economic development\n\n### WAEC Exam Preparation\n- Concepts of national income\n- Methods of measuring national income\n- Economic growth and development\n- Government economic policies\n\n### Study Tips\n- Study current economic data and statistics\n- Understand different GDP calculations\n- Learn about economic indicators\n- Analyze government economic reports\n\n### Additional Resources\n- National Bureau of Statistics reports\n- World Bank economic data\n- Economics textbooks\n- Financial news and analysis\n        ",
