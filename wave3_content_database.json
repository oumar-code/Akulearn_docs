      "content": "# Quadratic Equations: Mastery Guide\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nA **quadratic equation** is a polynomial equation of degree 2, written in the standard form:\n\n**ax² + bx + c = 0**\n\nWhere:\n- a, b, c are constants (a ≠ 0)\n- x is the variable\n- a is the coefficient of x²\n- b is the coefficient of x\n- c is the constant term\n\n## 2. Methods of Solving Quadratic Equations\n\n### Method 1: Factorization\n\n**When to use**: When the equation can be easily factored\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Write equation in standard form (ax² + bx + c = 0)\n2. Factor the left side into two binomials\n3. Set each factor equal to zero\n4. Solve for x\n\n**Example**: x² - 5x + 6 = 0\n- Factor: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n- Solutions: x = 2 or x = 3\n\n### Method 2: Completing the Square\n\n**When to use**: When factorization is difficult, or to derive the quadratic formula\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Move constant to right side\n2. Make coefficient of x² equal to 1\n3. Add (b/2)² to both sides\n4. Take square root of both sides\n5. Solve for x\n\n**Example**: x² + 6x + 5 = 0\n- x² + 6x = -5\n- x² + 6x + 9 = -5 + 9\n- (x + 3)² = 4\n- x + 3 = ±2\n- x = -3 ± 2\n- Solutions: x = -1 or x = -5\n\n### Method 3: Quadratic Formula (Most Powerful!)\n\nFor any quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0:\n\n**x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a**\n\n**Discriminant (Δ)**: b² - 4ac\n\nNature of roots:\n- If Δ > 0: Two distinct real roots\n- If Δ = 0: One repeated real root\n- If Δ < 0: No real roots (complex roots)\n\n## 3. Nigerian Context Examples\n\n### Example 1: Market Pricing (Lagos)\nA trader at Idumota Market sells phones. The profit P (in Naira) is given by:\nP = -2x² + 120x - 1000\n\nWhere x is the number of phones sold per day.\n\n**Question**: How many phones should be sold to break even (P = 0)?\n\n**Solution**:\n-2x² + 120x - 1000 = 0\nDivide by -2: x² - 60x + 500 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\nx = [60 ± √(3600 - 2000)] / 2\nx = [60 ± √1600] / 2\nx = [60 ± 40] / 2\n\nx = 50 or x = 10\n\n**Answer**: The trader breaks even by selling either 10 or 50 phones per day.\n\n### Example 2: Construction (Abuja)\nA rectangular plot in Abuja has length 5m more than its width. The area is 300m².\n\n**Find**: The dimensions of the plot.\n\n**Solution**:\nLet width = x meters\nLength = (x + 5) meters\nArea: x(x + 5) = 300\nx² + 5x - 300 = 0\n\nFactor or use formula:\nx = [-5 ± √(25 + 1200)] / 2\nx = [-5 ± 35] / 2\n\nx = 15 or x = -20 (reject negative)\n\n**Answer**: Width = 15m, Length = 20m\n\n## 4. Graphing Quadratic Functions\n\nThe graph of y = ax² + bx + c is a **parabola**.\n\n**Key Features**:\n- **Vertex**: Turning point at x = -b/2a\n- **Axis of symmetry**: Vertical line through vertex\n- **Y-intercept**: Point (0, c)\n- **X-intercepts**: Roots of the equation\n\n**Direction**:\n- If a > 0: Opens upward (U-shape)\n- If a < 0: Opens downward (∩-shape)\n\n## 5. Exam Tips for WAEC\n\n✅ **Always check your discriminant first** - it tells you how many solutions to expect\n\n✅ **Show all working** - even if you use calculator, write down the formula and substitution\n\n✅ **Check your solutions** by substituting back into the original equation\n\n✅ **Watch for word problems** - translate Nigerian context into equations carefully\n\n✅ **Remember units** - if the problem mentions Naira (₦), meters, or time, include units in your answer\n\n## 6. Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n❌ Forgetting the ± sign in the quadratic formula\n❌ Arithmetic errors when calculating discriminant\n❌ Dividing by 2a instead of 2 in the formula\n❌ Not writing equation in standard form first\n❌ Accepting negative solutions for length, time, or quantity problems\n\n## 7. Practice Problems (Self-Check)\n\nSolve using any method:\n\n1. x² - 7x + 12 = 0\n2. 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0\n3. x² - 6x + 9 = 0\n4. x² + 4x + 5 = 0 (Find nature of roots)\n\n**Challenge Problem**: \nA ball is thrown upward from ground level in Port Harcourt. Its height h (in meters) after t seconds is:\nh = -5t² + 20t\n\nFind: (a) Maximum height reached\n      (b) Time when ball hits the ground\n\n## Summary\n\n- Three main solving methods: Factorization, Completing the Square, Quadratic Formula\n- Discriminant determines nature of roots\n- Real-world applications: projectiles, area, profit maximization\n- Always check your work by substitution\n",

Fundamental Concepts\n\n### Electric Current (I)\n- **Definition**: Rate of flow of electric charge\n- **Formula**: I = Q/t\n- **Unit**: Ampere (A) or Coulomb per second (C/s)\n- **Direction**: Conventional current flows from positive to negative\n\n### Potential Difference/Voltage (V)\n- **Definition**: Work done per unit charge\n- **Formula**: V = W/Q\n- **Unit**: Volt (V) or Joule per Coulomb (J/C)\n- **Meaning**: \"Electrical pressure\" that pushes charges\n\n### Resistance (R)\n- **Definition**: Opposition to current flow\n- **Formula**: R = ρL/A (where ρ = resistivity, L = length, A = area)\n- **Unit**: Ohm (Ω)\n- **Factors**: Material, length, cross-sectional area, temperature\n\n## 2. Ohm's Law ⭐⭐⭐\n\n**V = IR**\n\nMost important formula in electricity!\n\nIf you know any two quantities, you can find the third:\n- V = IR (voltage equals current times resistance)\n- I = V/R (current equals voltage divided by resistance)\n- R = V/I (resistance equals voltage divided by current)\n\n## 3. Series Circuits\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Current is **same** through all components: I = I₁ = I₂ = I₃\n- Voltage is **shared**: V = V₁ + V₂ + V₃\n- Total resistance **adds up**: Rtotal = R₁ + R₂ + R₃\n\n**When to use**: Christmas lights, simple torch circuits\n\n## 4. Parallel Circuits\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Voltage is **same** across all branches: V = V₁ = V₂ = V₃\n- Current is **shared**: I = I₁ + I₂ + I₃\n- Reciprocal of total resistance: 1/Rtotal = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃\n\n**When to use**: Home wiring, appliances that need same voltage\n\n## 5. Electrical Power and Energy\n\n**Power Formulas**:\n- P = VI (most common)\n- P = I²R (useful when you know current and resistance)\n- P = V²/R (useful when you know voltage and resistance)\n\n**Energy**: E = Pt (Energy = Power × Time)\n\n**Cost of Electricity** (Nigerian Context):\nCost = Energy (kWh) × Tariff (₦/kWh)\n\n## 6. Nigerian Context: NEPA/PHCN Calculations\n\n### Example: Monthly Electricity Bill in Lagos\n\n**Appliances in a home**:\n- 5 LED bulbs (10W each) × 6 hours/day\n- 1 Fan (75W) × 8 hours/day\n- 1 TV (100W) × 4 hours/day\n- 1 Fridge (150W) × 24 hours/day\n\n**Monthly consumption**:\n- Bulbs: 5 × 10W × 6h × 30 days = 9 kWh\n- Fan: 75W × 8h × 30 = 18 kWh\n- TV: 100W × 4h × 30 = 12 kWh\n- Fridge: 150W × 24h × 30 = 108 kWh\n- **Total**: 147 kWh/month\n\n**Cost** (at ₦68/kWh):\n147 kWh × ₦68 = ₦9,996 per month\n\n## 7. WAEC Exam Tips\n\n✅ **Always write formulas first** - shows you know the concept\n\n✅ **List given values** - helps you organize your solution\n\n✅ **Show unit conversions** - mA to A, kW to W, etc.\n\n✅ **Draw circuit diagrams** when asked - label all components\n\n✅ **Check your answer** - Does the current make sense? Is resistance positive?\n\n## 8. Common Mistakes\n\n❌ Forgetting to convert units (mA to A, kW to W)\n❌ Using series formulas for parallel circuits (and vice versa)\n❌ Mixing up voltage division vs current division\n❌ Not showing working - even if you use calculator\n❌ Wrong formula for parallel resistance (don't just add!)\n\n## Summary\n\n- Ohm's Law: V = IR (memorize this!)\n- Series: Same current, voltage adds\n- Parallel: Same voltage, current adds\n- Power: P = VI = I²R = V²/R\n- Practice with Nigerian context problems\n",

Types of Reproduction\n\n### Asexual Reproduction\n- **One parent** only\n- **No gametes** (sex cells)\n- Offspring **genetically identical** to parent (clones)\n- **Faster** than sexual reproduction\n\n### Sexual Reproduction\n- **Two parents** (male and female)\n- Involves **gametes** (sperm and egg)\n- Offspring **genetically different** from parents\n- Provides **variation** for adaptation\n\n## 2. Asexual Reproduction Methods\n\n### Binary Fission\n- Single organism splits into two\n- Example: Bacteria, Amoeba\n- Very rapid multiplication\n\n### Budding\n- Small outgrowth (bud) forms on parent\n- Bud detaches and grows independently\n- Example: Yeast, Hydra\n\n### Vegetative Propagation\n- New plants from vegetative parts\n- Examples:\n  * Stem: Cassava, Sugarcane\n  * Root: Sweet potato\n  * Tuber: Yam, Potato\n  * Bulb: Onion, Garlic\n  * Rhizome: Ginger\n\n### Spore Formation\n- Produces many spores\n- Spores dispersed by wind\n- Example: Fungi, Ferns\n\n## 3. Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\n\n### Parts of a Flower\n\n**Male Parts (Stamen)**:\n- Anther: Produces pollen grains\n- Filament: Supports anther\n\n**Female Parts (Carpel/Pistil)**:\n- Stigma: Receives pollen\n- Style: Tube connecting stigma to ovary\n- Ovary: Contains ovules (eggs)\n\n### Pollination\n**Definition**: Transfer of pollen from anther to stigma\n\n**Types**:\n1. **Self-Pollination**: Same flower or same plant\n2. **Cross-Pollination**: Different plants (same species)\n\n**Agents of Pollination**:\n- **Wind**: Light, dry pollen; abundant; feathery stigma (e.g., maize, grasses)\n- **Insects**: Bright colors, nectar, scent, sticky pollen (e.g., hibiscus, sunflower)\n- **Birds**: Bright red/orange, lots of nectar (e.g., bird of paradise)\n- **Water**: Aquatic plants\n\n### Fertilization\n1. Pollen lands on stigma\n2. Pollen tube grows down style\n3. Male nucleus travels through tube\n4. Reaches ovary, fuses with egg\n5. Forms zygote → embryo → seed\n6. Ovary becomes fruit\n\n## 4. Sexual Reproduction in Humans\n\n### Male Reproductive System\n- Testes: Produce sperm and testosterone\n- Sperm duct: Transports sperm\n- Penis: Delivers sperm\n\n### Female Reproductive System\n- Ovaries: Produce eggs (ova) and hormones\n- Fallopian tubes: Site of fertilization\n- Uterus: Where baby develops\n- Vagina: Birth canal\n\n### Fertilization\n- Sperm meets egg in fallopian tube\n- Fusion forms zygote\n- Zygote implants in uterus\n- Develops into embryo → fetus → baby\n- **Gestation period**: 9 months (280 days)\n\n## 5. Nigerian Agricultural Context\n\n### Asexual Reproduction in Farming\n- **Cassava**: Stem cuttings planted\n- **Yam**: Seed yam (tuber piece) planted\n- **Plantain**: Suckers transplanted\n- **Advantages**: Faster, maintains good traits\n\n### Sexual Reproduction in Farming\n- **Maize**: Pollinated by wind, grows from seed\n- **Tomatoes**: Insect-pollinated, grows from seed\n- **Advantages**: Produces variation, disease resistance\n\n## 6. WAEC Exam Tips\n\n✅ **Label flower diagrams** clearly (stigma, anther, ovary, etc.)\n✅ **Distinguish** self vs cross-pollination\n✅ **State agents** of pollination with examples\n✅ **Compare** asexual vs sexual reproduction\n✅ **Use Nigerian examples** (cassava, yam, maize)\n✅ **Know fertilization process** step-by-step\n\n## 7. Common WAEC Questions\n\n1. Explain the term pollination\n2. State 3 differences between asexual and sexual reproduction\n3. Draw and label parts of a flower\n4. Describe fertilization in flowering plants\n5. Name 2 crops propagated vegetatively\n\n## Practice Questions\n\n1. What is the male gamete in plants?\n2. Where does fertilization occur in humans?\n3. Give 2 advantages of sexual reproduction\n4. Name the process by which yam is propagated\n5. State 3 agents of cross-pollination\n\n## Summary\n\n- Two main types: Asexual (one parent) and Sexual (two parents)\n- Asexual: Binary fission, budding, vegetative propagation, spores\n- Sexual (plants): Pollination → Fertilization → Seed formation\n- Nigerian crops: Cassava (asexual), Maize (sexual)\n- Sexual reproduction provides variation for adaptation\n",

In Nigeria, trigonometry has practical applications in surveying (Abuja city planning), telecommunications (MTN cell tower positioning), civil engineering (Niger Bridge construction), and navigation (River Niger shipping routes).\n\n## Part 1: Trigonometric Ratios (SOHCAHTOA)\n\n### The Foundation\n\nFor a right-angled triangle with angle θ:\n\n**SOH**: sin θ = Opposite/Hypotenuse\n**CAH**: cos θ = Adjacent/Hypotenuse  \n**TOA**: tan θ = Opposite/Adjacent\n\n### Nigerian Example: MTN Cell Tower Height\n\n**Problem**: An MTN engineer in Lagos stands 50 meters from the base of a cell tower. The angle of elevation to the top is 67°. Find the tower's height.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\ntan 67° = height/50\nheight = 50 × tan 67°\nheight = 50 × 2.356\nheight ≈ 117.8 meters\n```\n\n**Answer**: The MTN tower is approximately 118 meters tall.\n\n**WAEC Tip**: Always draw a diagram first! Label the known values and the unknown you're solving for.\n\n## Part 2: Angles of Elevation and Depression\n\n### Nigerian Example: Aso Rock Measurement\n\n**Problem**: From a point 200 meters from the base of Aso Rock in Abuja, the angle of elevation to the peak is 52°. Calculate the height of the rock formation.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\ntan 52° = height/200\nheight = 200 × tan 52°\nheight = 200 × 1.280\nheight ≈ 256 meters\n```\n\n**Answer**: Aso Rock is approximately 256 meters high.\n\n### Angle of Depression Example: Kainji Dam Observation\n\n**Problem**: An engineer at the top of Kainji Dam (80 meters high) observes a boat on the Niger River. The angle of depression is 35°. How far is the boat from the base of the dam?\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nAngle of depression = Angle of elevation (alternate angles)\ntan 35° = 80/distance\ndistance = 80/tan 35°\ndistance = 80/0.700\ndistance ≈ 114.3 meters\n```\n\n**Answer**: The boat is approximately 114 meters from the dam.\n\n## Part 3: Bearings and Navigation\n\n### Understanding Bearings\n\n- Bearings are measured clockwise from North (000°)\n- Written as three-figure bearings: 045°, 120°, 270°\n- Back bearings differ by 180°\n\n### Nigerian Example: Navigation on River Niger\n\n**Problem**: A cargo ship travels from Lokoja to Baro on the Niger River. It sails 80 km on a bearing of 055°, then 60 km on a bearing of 125°. Find the direct distance and bearing from Lokoja to its final position.\n\n**Solution** (Using Cosine Rule):\n```\nAngle between paths = 125° - 055° = 70°\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C\nc² = 80² + 60² - 2(80)(60) cos 70°\nc² = 6400 + 3600 - 9600(0.342)\nc² = 10000 - 3283\nc² = 6717\nc ≈ 82 km\n\nUsing Sine Rule for bearing:\nsin A/60 = sin 70°/82\nsin A = (60 × 0.940)/82\nsin A = 0.688\nA ≈ 43.4°\n\nFinal bearing = 55° + 43.4° ≈ 098°\n```\n\n**Answer**: The ship is 82 km from Lokoja on a bearing of 098°.\n\n## Part 4: Sine Rule\n\n**Formula**: a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C\n\n### Nigerian Example: Surveying Obudu Cattle Ranch\n\n**Problem**: A surveyor at Obudu Cattle Ranch needs to measure the distance across a valley. From point A, the distance to point B is 250 meters. The angle at A is 75° and the angle at B is 60°.

In Nigeria, we see energy transformations everywhere: the 960 MW Kainji Dam converts water's potential energy to electricity, solar panels in Kaduna convert light energy, and generators in Lagos convert chemical energy from petrol into electrical energy. Understanding work, energy, and power is essential for WAEC success and real-world applications.\n\n## Part 1: Work Done\n\n### Definition\n\n**Work is done when a force moves an object through a distance in the direction of the force.**\n\n**Formula**: W = F × d × cos θ\n\nWhere:\n- W = Work done (Joules, J)\n- F = Force applied (Newtons, N)\n- d = Distance moved (meters, m)\n- θ = Angle between force and direction of motion\n\n### Nigerian Example: Alaba International Market\n\n**Problem**: A trader at Alaba Market pushes a cart loaded with electronics 20 meters across the floor with a force of 150 N. Calculate the work done.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nW = F × d\nW = 150 N × 20 m\nW = 3,000 J = 3 kJ\n```\n\n**Answer**: The trader does 3,000 Joules (3 kJ) of work.\n\n**WAEC Tip**: If the force and motion are in the same direction, θ = 0° and cos 0° = 1, so W = F × d.\n\n### Example with Angle: Carrying Water Up Slope\n\n**Problem**: In a rural Nigerian village, a woman carries a 20 kg bucket of water (weight = 200 N) up a 10-meter slope inclined at 30° to the horizontal. Find the work done against gravity.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nVertical height = 10 × sin 30° = 10 × 0.5 = 5 m\nW = F × h\nW = 200 N × 5 m\nW = 1,000 J = 1 kJ\n```\n\n**Answer**: Work done against gravity is 1,000 J.\n\n## Part 2: Forms of Energy\n\n### 1. Kinetic Energy (KE)\n\n**Energy of motion**\n\n**Formula**: KE = ½mv²\n\nWhere:\n- m = mass (kg)\n- v = velocity (m/s)\n\n### Nigerian Example: BRT Bus in Lagos\n\n**Problem**: A BRT bus with mass 8,000 kg travels at 20 m/s on Ikorodu Road. Calculate its kinetic energy.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nKE = ½mv²\nKE = ½ × 8,000 × (20)²\nKE = 4,000 × 400\nKE = 1,600,000 J = 1.6 MJ\n```\n\n**Answer**: The bus has 1.6 megajoules of kinetic energy.\n\n### 2. Potential Energy (PE)\n\n**Energy due to position**\n\n**Formula**: PE = mgh\n\nWhere:\n- m = mass (kg)\n- g = 10 m/s² (gravitational field strength)\n- h = height (m)\n\n### Nigerian Example: Elevated Water Tank in Lagos\n\n**Problem**: A water tank in Victoria Island is 15 meters above ground and holds 2,000 kg of water. Calculate the potential energy of the water.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nPE = mgh\nPE = 2,000 × 10 × 15\nPE = 300,000 J = 300 kJ\n```\n\n**Answer**: The water has 300 kilojoules of potential energy.\n\n## Part 3: Conservation of Energy\n\n**Principle**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.\n\n**Total Energy**: KE + PE = constant (in the absence of friction)\n\n### Nigerian Example: Kainji Dam Hydroelectric Power\n\n**Problem**: Water at the top of Kainji Dam (80 m high) has mass 10,000 kg. Calculate:\na) Potential energy at the top\nb) Kinetic energy just before hitting turbines (bottom)\nc) Velocity at the bottom\n\n**Solution**:\n```\na) PE at top = mgh = 10,000 × 10 × 80 = 8,000,000 J = 8 MJ\n\nb) By conservation: PE(top) = KE(bottom)\n   KE = 8,000,000 J = 8 MJ\n\nc) KE = ½mv²\n   8,000,000 = ½ × 10,000 × v²\n   v² = 1,600\n   v = 40 m/s\n```\n\n**Answer**: \na) PE = 8 MJ\nb) KE = 8 MJ  \nc) v = 40 m/s\n\n**Real Context**: Kainji Dam generates 960 MW, supplying electricity to northern and western Nigeria.\n\n## Part 4: Power\n\n### Definition\n\n**Power is the rate of doing work or rate of energy transfer.**\n\n**Formula**: P = W/t = E/t\n\nWhere:\n- P = Power (Watts, W)\n- W = Work done (J)\n- t = Time taken (s)\n- E = Energy transferred (J)\n\n**Also**: P = Fv (Power = Force × velocity)\n\n### Nigerian Example: NEPA/PHCN Electricity Bill\n\n**Problem**: A Nigerian household in Lagos uses 300 kWh of electrical energy in a month (30 days). Calculate:\na) Average power consumption\nb) Monthly cost at ₦68/kWh\n\n**Solution**:\n```\na) Energy = 300 kWh = 300,000 Wh = 300 × 3,600,000 J\n   Time = 30 days = 30 × 24 × 3600 s = 2,592,000 s\n   P = E/t = 300 kWh / (30 × 24) h\n   P = 300/720 kW = 0.417 kW ≈ 417 W\n\nb) Cost = 300 kWh × ₦68/kWh = ₦20,400\n```\n\n**Answer**: \na) Average power = 417 W\nb) Monthly cost = ₦20,400\n\n### Generator Fuel Consumption\n\n**Problem**: A 5 kW generator in Lagos runs for 8 hours daily. If fuel costs ₦617/litre and consumption is 0.5 litres/hour, find monthly fuel cost (30 days).\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nDaily consumption = 8 hours × 0.5 litres/hour = 4 litres\nMonthly consumption = 30 × 4 = 120 litres\nMonthly cost = 120 × ₦617 = ₦74,040\n```\n\n**Answer**: Monthly fuel cost = ₦74,040\n\n## Part 5: Efficiency\n\n### Definition\n\n**Efficiency = (Useful output energy/Total input energy) × 100%**\n\n**Also**: Efficiency = (Output power/Input power) × 100%\n\n### Nigerian Example: Solar Panels in Kaduna\n\n**Problem**: A solar panel system in Kaduna receives 10,000 J of light energy per second and produces 1,800 J of electrical energy per second. Calculate:\na) Efficiency\nb) Output power\nc) Wasted power\n\n**Solution**:\n```\na) Efficiency = (1,800/10,000) × 100% = 18%\n\nb) Output power = 1,800 J/s = 1,800 W = 1.8 kW\n\nc) Wasted power = Input - Output = 10,000 - 1,800 = 8,200 W = 8.2 kW\n```\n\n**Answer**: \na) Efficiency = 18%\nb) Output power = 1.8 kW\nc) Wasted power = 8.2 kW\n\n**Real Context**: Solar panel efficiency in Nigeria typically ranges from 15-22%, with northern regions like Kaduna, Sokoto, and Kano having excellent solar potential.\n\n## Worked Examples\n\n### Example 1: Lifting Dangote Cement Bags\n\n**Problem**: A worker lifts a 50 kg bag of Dangote cement vertically through 2 meters in 3 seconds. Calculate:\na) Work done\nb) Power developed\n\n**Solution**:\n```\na) Weight = mg = 50 × 10 = 500 N\n   W = F × d = 500 × 2 = 1,000 J\n\nb) P = W/t = 1,000/3 = 333.3 W\n```\n\n**Answer**: a) 1,000 J, b) 333 W\n\n### Example 2: Okada Motorcycle in Lagos Traffic\n\n**Problem**: An Okada (motorcycle taxi) with total mass 200 kg (bike + rider) accelerates from rest to 15 m/s. Calculate the kinetic energy gained.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nInitial KE = 0 (at rest)\nFinal KE = ½mv² = ½ × 200 × (15)² = 100 × 225 = 22,500 J = 22.5 kJ\n```\n\n**Answer**: Kinetic energy gained = 22.5 kJ\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n### Problem 1: Eko Bridge Traffic\nA car of mass 1,200 kg travels at 25 m/s on Eko Bridge, Lagos. Calculate its kinetic energy.\n\n**Hint**: Use KE = ½mv²\n\n### Problem 2: Water Tower\nA 500 kg water tank is mounted 20 m above ground in Kano.

Calculate the average power consumption.\n\n**Hint**: Convert kWh to Wh, then use P = E/t\n\n### Problem 4: Pump Efficiency\nA water pump uses 5,000 J of electrical energy to lift 40 kg of water through 10 m. Calculate its efficiency.\n\n**Hint**: Useful output = mgh, then find (output/input) × 100%\n\n## WAEC Exam Strategies\n\n1. **Unit Conversions**: Be careful with kW ↔ W, kJ ↔ J, kWh ↔ J\n2. **Show All Working**: Method marks are awarded even if final answer is wrong\n3. **State Formulas**: Always write the formula before substituting values\n4. **Use g = 10 m/s²**: Unless stated otherwise in the question\n5. **Check Direction**: Work is only done when force and motion are in same direction\n6. **Conservation of Energy**: Remember PE at top = KE at bottom (no friction)\n7. **Efficiency**: Always less than 100% due to wasted energy\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n1. Confusing work (Joules) with power (Watts)\n2. Forgetting to square velocity in KE = ½mv²\n3. Using wrong units (must convert to SI units)\n4. Not considering direction of force in work calculations\n5. Assuming 100% efficiency (there's always energy loss)\n\n## Nigerian Context Summary\n\n**Real-World Applications**:\n- **Energy Generation**: Kainji Dam (960 MW hydroelectric)\n- **Solar Power**: Kaduna, Sokoto solar farms (15-22% efficiency)\n- **Domestic**: NEPA/PHCN bills (₦68/kWh), generator fuel costs (₦617/L)\n- **Transport**: BRT buses, Okada motorcycles, Air Peace aircraft\n- **Industry**: Dangote factories, Alaba Market logistics\n- **Water Supply**: Elevated tanks in Lagos, Victoria Island\n\n**Typical Costs**:\n- Electricity: ₦68/kWh (Lagos tariff)\n- Generator fuel: ₦617/litre petrol\n- Diesel generators: 0.3-0.5 litres/kWh\n- Monthly household bill: ₦15,000-50,000\n- Solar panel installation: ₦500,000-2M (5-10 kW system)\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nAfter studying this lesson, you should be able to:\n1. ✓ Calculate work done by a force\n2. ✓ Determine kinetic and potential energy\n3. ✓ Apply conservation of energy principle\n4. ✓ Calculate power and understand its units\n5. ✓ Determine efficiency of energy conversions\n6. ✓ Solve Nigerian real-world energy problems\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Force and motion concepts\n- Basic algebra\n- Unit conversions\n- Understanding of energy concept\n\n## Next Topics\n\n- Simple machines\n- Heat and temperature\n- Electrical energy\n- Renewable energy sources\n",

      "content": "\n# Nutrition in Plants: Feeding Nigeria's Farms\n\n## Introduction\nNigeria feeds 220 million people through agriculture. From cassava farms in Benue to cocoa plantations in Ondo, from yam cultivation in Enugu to maize fields in Kaduna—all depend on plant nutrition. Understanding photosynthesis and mineral requirements is essential for Nigerian food security.\n\n## Part 1: Photosynthesis - The Foundation\n\n### The Process\n**6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂**\n(Carbon dioxide + Water → Glucose + Oxygen)\n\n### Requirements\n1. **Chlorophyll** - Green pigment in chloroplasts\n2. **Light energy** - From sunlight\n3. **Carbon dioxide** - From air (0.04%)\n4. **Water** - From soil via roots\n\n### Products\n1. **Glucose** - Used for energy, growth, storage\n2. **Oxygen** - Released to atmosphere\n\n### Worked Example 1: Cassava Photosynthesis (Benue State)\nA cassava farm in Benue has 10,000 plants. Each plant has ~200 leaves averaging 400 cm² per leaf.\n\n**Calculate total photosynthetic surface area**.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Leaves per plant = 200\n- Total plants = 10,000\n- Total leaves = 200 × 10,000 = 2,000,000 leaves\n- Area per leaf = 400 cm² = 0.04 m²\n- Total area = 2,000,000 × 0.04 = 80,000 m²\n- **Total area = 8 hectares of photosynthetic surface**\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Large surface area explains why cassava is efficient at producing tubers (40-50 tonnes/hectare possible with good fertilizer).\n\n## Part 2: Factors Affecting Photosynthesis\n\n### 1. Light Intensity\n- **Too low**: Slow photosynthesis (cloudy days, rainy season)\n- **Optimal**: Bright sunlight (Nigerian dry season)\n- **Too high**: No further increase (light saturation)\n\n### Nigerian Example: Cocoa Under Shade\nIn Ondo State, cocoa trees grow under taller trees (plantain, kola).\n\n**Why?** Young cocoa needs 50-70% shade:\n- Prevents excessive light damage\n- Reduces water loss\n- Optimal photosynthesis at moderate light\n- Mature cocoa tolerates more light\n\n**Economics**: Shade trees = ₦50,000 investment, but increase cocoa yield by 30%\n\n### 2. Carbon Dioxide Concentration\n- Normal air: 0.04% CO₂\n- Optimal: 0.1% CO₂ (2.5× normal)\n- Limiting factor in closed spaces\n\n### 3. Temperature\n- **Too low** (<10°C): Enzymes inactive (not common in Nigeria)\n- **Optimal**: 25-35°C (Nigerian average)\n- **Too high** (>40°C): Enzymes denature, stomata close\n\n### Worked Example 2: Maize Growth in Kaduna\nIn Kaduna, maize grows in two seasons:\n\n**Dry season irrigation**:\n- Temperature: 30-35°C (optimal)\n- Light: High intensity (clear skies)\n- Water: Supplemented by irrigation\n- Growth: 3-4 months, 6-8 tonnes/hectare\n\n**Rainy season**:\n- Temperature: 25-30°C (good)\n- Light: Reduced (cloudy days)\n- Water: Abundant\n- Growth: 4-5 months, 4-6 tonnes/hectare\n\n**Analysis**: Dry season yields more despite needing irrigation because of higher light intensity and temperature.\n\n### 4. Water Availability\n- Required for photosynthesis\n- Maintains turgor pressure\n- Transport medium for nutrients\n- Cooling (transpiration)\n\n## Part 3: Mineral Nutrition\n\n### Macronutrients (Needed in Large Amounts)\n\n#### Nitrogen (N)\n- **Function**: Protein synthesis, chlorophyll, amino acids\n- **Deficiency**: Yellow older leaves, stunted growth\n- **Nigerian source**: Urea (46% N), NPK fertilizer\n- **Cost**: ₦15,000 per 50kg NPK 20-10-10\n\n#### Phosphorus (P)\n- **Function**: DNA, RNA, ATP (energy), root development\n- **Deficiency**: Dark green/purple leaves, poor root growth\n- **Nigerian source**: Single superphosphate, NPK\n- **Application**: Important for yam, cassava root formation\n\n#### Potassium (K)\n- **Function**: Enzyme activation, stomata operation, disease resistance\n- **Deficiency**: Yellow leaf edges, weak stems\n- **Nigerian source**: Muriate of potash, NPK fertilizer\n\n### Micronutrients (Needed in Small Amounts)\n- Iron (Fe) - Chlorophyll synthesis\n- Magnesium (Mg) - Center of chlorophyll molecule\n- Calcium (Ca) - Cell wall formation\n- Sulfur (S) - Protein synthesis\n\n### Worked Example 3: NPK Fertilizer Application (Benue Cassava Farm)\nA farmer applies NPK 20-10-10 at 300 kg/hectare on 5 hectares.\n\n**Calculate nutrients applied:**\n\n**Solution**:\n- Total NPK = 300 kg/ha × 5 ha = 1,500 kg\n- **Nitrogen**: 20% of 1,500 = 300 kg pure N\n- **Phosphorus**: 10% of 1,500 = 150 kg pure P₂O₅\n- **Potassium**: 10% of 1,500 = 150 kg pure K₂O\n\n**Cost**: 1,500 kg ÷ 50 kg/bag = 30 bags\n30 bags × ₦15,000 = **₦450,000 total fertilizer cost**\n\n**Expected yield increase**: \n- Without fertilizer: 15 tonnes/ha\n- With fertilizer: 30-40 tonnes/ha\n- Extra yield: 15-25 tonnes/ha × 5 ha = 75-125 tonnes\n- @ ₦50,000/tonne = ₦3.75-6.25M revenue\n- **Profit after fertilizer**: ₦3.3-5.8M\n\n**ROI**: 733-1289% return on fertilizer investment!\n\n## Part 4: Nutrient Deficiency in Nigerian Crops\n\n### Nitrogen Deficiency (Most Common)\n**Symptoms**:\n- Yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis)\n- Stunted growth\n- Thin, weak stems\n\n**Nigerian crops affected**: Maize, rice, vegetables\n\n**Solution**: Apply urea (46% N) at 100-200 kg/ha or NPK\n\n**Prevention**: Regular fertilizer application, crop rotation with legumes (beans, cowpea)\n\n### Phosphorus Deficiency\n**Symptoms**:\n- Dark green or purple leaves\n- Poor root development\n- Delayed maturity\n\n**Nigerian crops affected**: Yam, cassava, sweet potato\n\n**Solution**: Single superphosphate at planting\n\n### Iron Deficiency (Chlorosis)\n**Symptoms**:\n- Yellow young leaves (veins stay green)\n- Interveinal chlorosis\n\n**Nigerian crops affected**: Citrus, vegetables in alkaline soils\n\n**Solution**: Foliar spray of iron chelate, adjust soil pH\n\n### Worked Example 4: Diagnosing Maize Deficiency (Kaduna)\nA farmer notices his maize has:\n- Yellow older leaves\n- Thin, weak stems  \n- Slow growth despite adequate water\n\n**Diagnosis**: Nitrogen deficiency\n\n**Treatment**:\n1. Apply urea (46% N) at 150 kg/hectare\n2. Or NPK 20-10-10 at 200 kg/hectare\n3. Split application: Half at 3 weeks, half at 6 weeks\n4. Expect improvement in 1-2 weeks\n\n**Cost**: Urea 150kg @ ₦20,000/50kg = ₦60,000/hectare\n\n## Part 5: Transport in Plants\n\n### Xylem (Water & Minerals Up)\n- Dead cells forming tubes\n- Transport from roots to leaves\n- Driven by transpiration pull\n- Contains dissolved minerals (N, P, K, etc.)\n\n### Phloem (Sugars/Food Down)\n- Living cells (sieve tubes)\n- Transport sugars from leaves to storage organs\n- Bidirectional flow\n- Active transport (requires energy)\n\n### Worked Example 5: Water Uptake in Palm Trees (Southeast Nigeria)\nAn oil palm tree in Imo State transpires 40 liters of water daily during dry season.\n\n**Calculate weekly water requirement:**\n\n**Solution**:\n- Daily: 40 liters\n- Weekly: 40 × 7 = 280 liters = 280 kg water\n- Annual: 40 × 365 = 14,600 liters ≈ 14.6 tonnes\n\n**Implication**: This water carries dissolved NPK nutrients from soil to leaves. Without adequate soil moisture, nutrient uptake is impaired even with fertilizer application.\n\n**Nigerian farming practice**: Mulching around palm base conserves soil moisture, reduces transpiration losses.\n\n## Part 6: Nigerian Agricultural Applications\n\n### Cassava Farming (40 million tonnes/year)\n- Main producing states: Benue, Cross River, Delta\n- NPK requirement: 300-400 kg/ha (20-10-10)\n- Yield: 15-40 tonnes/ha depending on fertilizer\n- Market price: ₦50,000/tonne (₦750,000-2M/ha revenue)\n\n### Yam Cultivation (47 million tonnes/year - world's largest)\n- Main states: Benue, Taraba, Enugu, Niger\n- High P requirement for tuber development\n- NPK 12-12-17 at 300 kg/ha\n- Yield: 15-30 tonnes/ha\n- Price: ₦200-300/kg (₦3-9M/ha revenue)\n\n### Cocoa Production (250,000+ tonnes/year)\n- Main states: Ondo, Cross River, Osun, Edo\n- Shade requirements (50-70% for young trees)\n- NPK 15-15-15 at 200 kg/ha\n- Yield: 400-800 kg/ha dried beans\n- Export price: ₦1,500-2,000/kg\n\n### Maize Farming (11 million tonnes/year)\n- Main states: Kaduna, Kano, Niger, Taraba\n- N requirement very high (urea 200-300 kg/ha)\n- Yield: 4-8 tonnes/ha\n- Price: ₦200/kg (₦800,000-1.6M/ha)\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Photosynthesis equation**: Memorize word and chemical equations\n2. **Limiting factors**: Understand light, CO₂, temperature, water\n3. **Deficiency symptoms**: Yellow older leaves = N, Purple = P, Yellow edges = K\n4. **Practical skills**: Test for starch (iodine), test for CO₂ (limewater)\n5. **Nigerian examples**: Use local crops in answers (cassava, yam, maize)\n6. **Show calculations**: NPK percentages, fertilizer quantities\n7. **Draw diagrams**: Chloroplast structure, leaf cross-section\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: A 10-hectare cassava farm requires NPK 20-10-10 at 300 kg/ha. Calculate:\n(a) Total fertilizer needed (kg)\n(b) Number of 50kg bags\n(c) Total cost @ ₦15,000/bag\n(d) Pure nitrogen applied\n\n**Problem 2**: Describe three factors that limit photosynthesis in Nigerian cocoa farms and how farmers overcome each.\n\n**Problem 3**: A maize farmer notices yellow older leaves and stunted growth. Diagnose the deficiency and recommend treatment with calculations.\n\n## Key Equations Summary\n\n- **Photosynthesis**: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂\n- **NPK Calculation**: (% N/100) × Total fertilizer = Pure N\n- **Fertilizer Cost**: (Total kg ÷ 50 kg/bag) × ₦15,000/bag\n\n## Nigerian Context Importance\n\nPlant nutrition knowledge is critical for:\n- **Food security** - Feeding 220M+ population\n- **Farmer income** - 70% of rural livelihoods\n- **Export earnings** - Cocoa, cashew, sesame\n- **Industrial raw materials** - Cassava (starch), palm oil\n- **Environmental sustainability** - Proper fertilizer use\n- **Career opportunities** - Agronomy, agribusiness\n\nUnderstanding photosynthesis and mineral nutrition empowers Nigerian farmers to increase yields, improve incomes, and ensure food security!\n",

      "content": "\n# Nutrition in Animals: Understanding the Nigerian Diet\n\n## Introduction\nNigeria's rich culinary tradition—Jollof rice, Egusi soup, Pounded yam, Suya, Moi-moi—provides the nutrients our bodies need. Understanding nutrition helps explain why a balanced Nigerian diet includes these foods and how our digestive system processes them.\n\n## Part 1: Classes of Food\n\n### 1. Carbohydrates (Energy Foods)\n**Function**: Provide energy (1g = 4 kcal)\n\n**Nigerian sources**:\n- **Rice** (Jollof rice) - 80% carbohydrate\n- **Yam** (Pounded yam, boiled yam) - 28% carbohydrate\n- **Cassava** (Garri, fufu) - 38% carbohydrate\n- **Maize** (Corn, pap/ogi) - 75% carbohydrate\n- **Plantain** (Dodo, boiled) - 32% carbohydrate\n\n**Types**:\n- **Simple sugars**: Glucose, fructose (fruits, honey)\n- **Complex starches**: Rice, yam, cassava\n\n**Daily requirement**: 300-400g (60% of total energy)\n\n### 2. Proteins (Body-building Foods)\n**Function**: Growth, repair, enzymes, antibodies (1g = 4 kcal)\n\n**Nigerian sources**:\n- **Beans** (Moi-moi, Akara) - 22% protein\n- **Fish** (Tilapia, catfish, stockfish) - 20-25% protein\n- **Meat** (Beef, goat, chicken, suya) - 20-25% protein\n- **Eggs** - 13% protein\n- **Groundnuts** - 25% protein\n- **Soy beans** - 36% protein\n\n**Types**:\n- **Complete proteins**: Meat, fish, eggs (contain all essential amino acids)\n- **Incomplete proteins**: Beans, nuts (lack some amino acids)\n\n**Daily requirement**: 50-70g for adults\n\n### 3. Fats and Oils (Energy Storage)\n**Function**: Energy storage, insulation, vitamin absorption (1g = 9 kcal - highest energy)\n\n**Nigerian sources**:\n- **Palm oil** (Red oil) - Used in soups, stews\n- **Groundnut oil** - For frying\n- **Coconut oil** - Traditional cooking\n- **Butter/margarine** - Bread, baking\n- **Fish oil** (from oily fish)\n\n**Daily requirement**: 50-70g (25-30% of total energy)\n\n### 4. Vitamins (Regulatory/Protective)\n**Function**: Regulate body processes, prevent diseases\n\n**Key vitamins in Nigerian diet**:\n- **Vitamin A**: Palm oil (red color = carotene), carrots, green vegetables\n  - Deficiency: Night blindness, dry skin\n- **Vitamin C**: Oranges, tomatoes, peppers\n  - Deficiency: Scurvy (bleeding gums)\n- **Vitamin D**: Fish, eggs, sunshine (Nigeria has plenty!)\n  - Deficiency: Rickets (soft bones in children)\n- **Vitamin B complex**: Yam, rice, beans, meat\n  - Deficiency: Beriberi, anemia\n\n### 5. Minerals (Regulatory/Structural)\n**Function**: Bones, teeth, blood, enzymes\n\n**Key minerals**:\n- **Calcium**: Milk, fish (bones), vegetables\n  - Function: Strong bones and teeth\n- **Iron**: Meat, beans, green vegetables\n  - Function: Hemoglobin (carries oxygen)\n  - Deficiency: Anemia (common in Nigeria)\n- **Iodine**: Iodized salt, fish\n  - Function: Thyroid hormone\n  - Deficiency: Goiter (swollen neck)\n\n### 6. Water\n**Function**: Transport, temperature regulation, chemical reactions\n\n**Daily requirement**: 2-3 liters (8-10 glasses)\n\n**Nigerian context**: Pure water sachets (₦10 each), boreholes, treated tap water\n\n### 7. Fiber (Roughage)\n**Function**: Aids digestion, prevents constipation\n\n**Nigerian sources**: Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans\n\n## Part 2: Balanced Diet - The Nigerian Approach\n\n### Traditional 6-3-1 Method\nNigerian nutritionists recommend:\n- **6 portions**: Carbohydrates (Rice, yam, garri, etc.)\n- **3 portions**: Proteins (Fish, meat, beans)\n- **1 portion**: Vegetables/fruits\n\n### Sample Balanced Nigerian Meals\n\n#### Breakfast (₦500-800)\n- Bread + Akara + Pap\n- OR Boiled yam + egg sauce\n- OR Plantain + beans\n\n#### Lunch/Dinner (₦1,200-2,000)\n- **Main**: Jollof rice with chicken/fish\n- **Soup option**: Egusi soup + pounded yam + beef\n- **Swallow option**: Eba + vegetable soup + fish\n- **Side**: Salad, fruit\n\n**Daily cost for balanced diet in Lagos**: ₦1,500-2,500\n\n### Worked Example 1: Calculating Daily Nutrition Needs\nA 70kg adult male in Lagos needs:\n- Energy: 2,500 kcal/day\n- Protein: 56g/day (0.8g per kg body weight)\n- Fat: 70g/day\n\n**Sample menu**:\n- **Breakfast**: Bread (200 kcal) + Akara (150 kcal) + Pap (100 kcal) = 450 kcal, 12g protein\n- **Lunch**: Jollof rice (400 kcal) + Chicken (200 kcal) + Salad (50 kcal) = 650 kcal, 25g protein\n- **Dinner**: Pounded yam (500 kcal) + Egusi soup (300 kcal) + Fish (150 kcal) = 950 kcal, 30g protein\n- **Snacks**: Fruits, nuts (400 kcal), 8g protein\n\n**Total**: 2,450 kcal, 75g protein ✅ **Meets requirements**\n\n## Part 3: Human Digestive System\n\n### Organs and Functions\n\n#### 1. Mouth (Oral Cavity)\n**Process**: Mechanical digestion (chewing), chemical digestion (saliva)\n- **Teeth**: Break food into smaller pieces\n- **Saliva**: Contains amylase enzyme\n- **Reaction**: Starch → Maltose (sugar)\n\n**Nigerian example**: Chewing pounded yam requires strong molars; saliva begins breaking down starch immediately.\n\n#### 2. Esophagus (Food Pipe)\n**Process**: Peristalsis (wave-like muscle contractions push food down)\n- Length: ~25 cm\n- Time: 10-15 seconds for food to reach stomach\n\n#### 3. Stomach\n**Process**: Mechanical churning + chemical digestion\n- **Gastric juice**: Contains HCl (pH 2) + pepsin enzyme\n- **Reaction**: Proteins → Peptides\n- **Time**: Food stays 2-4 hours\n\n**Nigerian example**: After eating suya (protein), pepsin breaks down meat proteins. Acidic environment kills bacteria.\n\n#### 4. Small Intestine (6-7 meters long)\n**Three parts**: Duodenum, Jejunum, Ileum\n\n**Duodenum** (first 25cm):\n- **Bile** (from liver): Emulsifies fats\n- **Pancreatic juice**: Contains lipase, amylase, trypsin\n- **Reactions**:\n  - Fats → Fatty acids + Glycerol (lipase)\n  - Starch → Maltose → Glucose (amylase)\n  - Proteins → Amino acids (trypsin)\n\n**Jejunum & Ileum**:\n- **Absorption**: Nutrients absorbed through villi into bloodstream\n- **Surface area**: Increased by millions of villi (finger-like projections)\n\n**Nigerian example**: After eating Egusi soup (high fat content), bile emulsifies the palm oil into tiny droplets, then lipase breaks them down for absorption.\n\n#### 5. Large Intestine (Colon)\n**Process**: Water reabsorption, formation of feces\n- Length: 1.5 meters\n- **Time**: 12-24 hours\n- **Absorption**: Water, vitamins\n\n**Nigerian context**: Adequate fiber (from vegetables) prevents constipation by retaining water in colon.\n\n#### 6. Rectum and Anus\n**Process**: Storage and elimination of feces (egestion)\n\n### Worked Example 2: Digestion Timeline for Nigerian Meal\nA person eats Jollof rice + chicken at 2:00 PM.\n\n**Timeline**:\n- **2:00 PM**: Mouth - Chewing, saliva begins starch digestion\n- **2:01 PM**: Swallowing, esophagus transport (15 seconds)\n- **2:01-6:00 PM**: Stomach - Protein digestion (4 hours)\n- **6:00-8:00 PM**: Small intestine - Complete digestion and absorption (2 hours)\n- **8:00 PM-10:00 AM** (next day): Large intestine - Water absorption (14 hours)\n- **10:00 AM**: Egestion (feces)\n\n**Total time**: Mouth to anus = ~20 hours\n\n## Part 4: Absorption and Assimilation\n\n### Villi Structure (Small Intestine)\n- **Shape**: Finger-like projections\n- **Function**: Increase surface area for absorption\n- **Structure**:\n  - Thin wall (one cell thick)\n  - Rich blood supply (capillaries)\n  - Lacteal (for fat absorption)\n\n### What Gets Absorbed Where\n\n**Small intestine**:\n- Glucose → Blood → Liver → Body cells\n- Amino acids → Blood → Liver → Body cells\n- Fatty acids + Glycerol → Lymph → Blood\n- Vitamins, minerals → Blood\n\n**Large intestine**:\n- Water → Blood\n- Vitamins (K, B12 produced by bacteria) → Blood\n\n### Assimilation\nNutrients used by body cells:\n- **Glucose**: Respiration for energy (or stored as glycogen)\n- **Amino acids**: Build new proteins (muscles, enzymes)\n- **Fatty acids**: Energy storage (or cell membranes)\n\n## Part 5: Food Tests (WAEC Practicals)\n\n### Test for Starch (Iodine Test)\n- **Reagent**: Iodine solution (brown)\n- **Positive result**: Blue-black color\n- **Nigerian foods**: Yam, cassava, rice, maize\n\n**Procedure**:\n1.

Bank savings grow in geometric progression (compound interest). Property prices in Lagos increase in arithmetic progression. Civil servant salaries follow predictable sequences. Understanding sequences and series unlocks the mathematics of growth, investment, and planning.\n\n## Part 1: Arithmetic Progression (AP)\n\n### Definition\nAn Arithmetic Progression is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\n\n**Form**: a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ...\n\n**Examples**:\n- 2, 5, 8, 11, ... (first term a=2, common difference d=3)\n- 100, 95, 90, 85, ... (a=100, d=-5)\n\n### Nigerian Example 1: Civil Servant Salary Progression\nA teacher starts at ₦120,000/month with ₦5,000 annual increment.\n\n**Sequence**:\n- Year 1: ₦120,000\n- Year 2: ₦125,000\n- Year 3: ₦130,000\n- Year 4: ₦135,000\n\nThis is AP with a = 120,000 and d = 5,000.\n\n### nth Term of AP\n**Formula**: Tₙ = a + (n-1)d\n\n**Problem**: What is the teacher's salary in year 10?\n- Tₙ = 120,000 + (10-1) × 5,000\n- T₁₀ = 120,000 + 45,000 = ₦165,000\n\n**WAEC Tip**: Always write the formula before substituting values!\n\n### Sum of n Terms of AP\n**Formula**: Sₙ = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d] OR Sₙ = n/2 (first + last)\n\n**Worked Example 1: Total Salary Over 10 Years**\nHow much total salary does the teacher earn in 10 years?\n\n**Solution**:\n- First term: a = 120,000\n- Last term (year 10): T₁₀ = 165,000\n- Number of terms: n = 10\n\n**Using formula**:\n- S₁₀ = 10/2 (120,000 + 165,000)\n- S₁₀ = 5 × 285,000\n- **S₁₀ = ₦1,425,000**\n\n**Meaning**: Total earnings over 10 years = ₦1.425 million\n\n## Part 2: Geometric Progression (GP)\n\n### Definition\nA Geometric Progression is a sequence where the ratio between consecutive terms is constant.\n\n**Form**: a, ar, ar², ar³, ...\n\n**Examples**:\n- 2, 6, 18, 54, ... (a=2, r=3)\n- 100, 50, 25, 12.5, ... (a=100, r=0.5)\n\n### Nigerian Example 2: Bank Compound Interest\n₦100,000 deposited in GTBank at 10% annual interest.\n\n**Balance after each year**:\n- Year 0: ₦100,000\n- Year 1: ₦100,000 × 1.1 = ₦110,000\n- Year 2: ₦110,000 × 1.1 = ₦121,000\n- Year 3: ₦133,100\n- Year 4: ₦146,410\n\n**This is GP** with a = 100,000 and r = 1.1\n\n### nth Term of GP\n**Formula**: Tₙ = ar^(n-1)\n\n**Problem**: How much money after 5 years?\n- T₅ = 100,000 × (1.1)⁴\n- T₅ = 100,000 × 1.4641\n- T₅ = **₦146,410**\n\n### Sum of n Terms of GP\n**Formula**: Sₙ = a(r^n - 1)/(r - 1) [when r ≠ 1]\n\n**Worked Example 2: Total Interest Earned**\nWhat is the total amount in bank account after 5 years?\n\n**Solution**:\n- a = 100,000\n- r = 1.1\n- n = 5\n\n**Using formula**:\n- S₅ = 100,000(1.1⁵ - 1)/(1.1 - 1)\n- S₅ = 100,000(1.6105 - 1)/0.1\n- S₅ = 100,000(0.6105)/0.1\n- S₅ = 100,000 × 6.105\n- **S₅ = ₦610,500** (total amount after 5 years)\n\n**Interest earned** = 610,500 - 100,000 × 5 = ₦110,500\n\n## Part 3: Sum to Infinity (GP Only)\n\n### When -1 < r < 1\nThe series approaches a finite limit.\n\n**Formula**: S∞ = a/(1-r)\n\n**Worked Example 3: Recurring Decimal**\nThe decimal 0.333... = 1/3 can be written as a GP.\n\n**0.333...** = 0.3 + 0.03 + 0.003 + ...\n- a = 0.3\n- r = 0.1\n- S∞ = 0.3/(1-0.1) = 0.3/0.9 = **1/3** ✓\n\n## Part 4: Real Nigerian Applications\n\n### Property Prices in Lagos\nLekki property values appreciate 5% annually (GP with r = 1.05).\n\nStarting price: ₦10,000,000 in 2020.\n\n**Price by year**:\n- 2020: ₦10,000,000\n- 2022: ₦10,000,000 × (1.05)² = ₦11,025,000\n- 2025: ₦10,000,000 × (1.05)⁵ = ₦12,762,815\n\n**Question**: After 10 years, value = ?\n- T₁₁ = 10,000,000 × (1.05)¹⁰ = ₦16,288,946\n\n### MTN Subscriber Growth\nMTN Nigeria adds 2 million subscribers annually (AP).\n\n**Year 1**: 60 million subscribers\n**Year 2**: 62 million\n**Year 3**: 64 million\n\n**Total subscribers by year 5**:\n- a = 60 million\n- d = 2 million\n- n = 5\n- S₅ = 5/2[2(60) + (5-1)×2] = 2.5[120 + 8] = **320 million subscriber-years**\n\n### Dangote Cement Distribution\nProduction increases 15% annually (GP with r = 1.15).\n\n**Starting production**: 5 million tonnes in 2020.\n\n**Projected for 2026**:\n- T₇ = 5 × (1.15)⁶ = 5 × 2.313 = **11.57 million tonnes**\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Identify the sequence**: Look for constant difference (AP) or constant ratio (GP)\n2. **Write known values**: a (first term), d or r, n (number of terms)\n3. **Choose correct formula**: AP or GP sum formula\n4. **Show substitution**: Write values into formula before calculating\n5. **State units**: Always include ₦, tonnes, years, etc.\n6. **Check reasonableness**: Does answer make sense in context?\n7. **Practice with negative terms**: Some sequences decrease\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: A trader's monthly profit increases from ₦50,000 by ₦10,000 each month. Find total profit in 12 months.\n\n**Problem 2**: UBA offers 8% compound interest on savings. If ₦500,000 is invested, find amount after 3 years.\n\n**Problem 3**: An AP has first term 5 and common difference 3. Find the sum of first 20 terms.\n\n**Problem 4**: A GP has first term 2 and common ratio 3. Find the 6th term.\n\n## Key Formulas\n\n- **AP nth term**: Tₙ = a + (n-1)d\n- **AP sum**: Sₙ = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]\n- **GP nth term**: Tₙ = ar^(n-1)\n- **GP sum**: Sₙ = a(r^n - 1)/(r - 1)\n- **GP infinite sum**: S∞ = a/(1-r) [when |r| < 1]\n\n## Nigerian Context Importance\n\nUnderstanding sequences helps with:\n- **Banking**: Calculate investment returns and loan repayment\n- **Business**: Project growth and sales forecasts\n- **Property**: Predict appreciation and investment value\n- **Demographics**: Plan for population changes\n- **Salary**: Understand career earning potential\n- **Telecommunications**: Analyze subscriber growth\n\nThis knowledge directly applies to Nigerian financial planning and business decisions!\n",

      "content": "\n# Temperature and Heat: From Lagos Climate to Nigerian Kitchens\n\n## Introduction\nEvery Nigerian experiences temperature daily: Lagos heat at 27°C, Jos coolness at 20°C, Sokoto's blazing 42°C. Food cooks at precise temperatures, vaccines need cold storage, and electricity consumption depends on climate. Understanding temperature and heat is essential for daily life in Nigeria.\n\n## Part 1: Temperature Scales\n\n### Celsius Scale\nMost common in Nigeria. Based on water freezing (0°C) and boiling (100°C) at sea level.\n\n**Nigerian Temperature Examples**:\n- Lagos average: 27°C (warm year-round)\n- Jos Plateau: 20°C (cooler highland)\n- Sokoto dry season: 42°C (very hot)\n- Cool room: 16°C\n- Normal body: 37°C\n- Fever: 39-40°C\n\n### Fahrenheit Scale\nUsed in some medical contexts and old British instruments.\n\n**Conversion**:\n- F = 9/5 × C + 32\n- C = 5/9 × (F - 32)\n\n**Worked Example 1: Lagos Temperature Conversion**\nLagos average is 27°C. Convert to Fahrenheit.\n- F = 9/5 × 27 + 32\n- F = 48.6 + 32\n- **F = 80.6°F** (warm and comfortable)\n\n### Kelvin Scale\nAbsolute temperature scale.

NEPA bills vary with electricity consumed. Worker productivity varies with rest time. Fertilizer yield varies with rainfall and nutrients. Understanding variation unlocks prediction and planning in Nigerian life.\n\n## Part 1: Direct Variation\n\n### Definition\ny varies directly with x means: y = kx\n\nwhere k is the constant of variation.\n\n**Property**: When x increases, y increases proportionally.\n\n### Nigerian Example 1: Taxi Fares in Lagos\nTypical rate: ₦100 per kilometer\n\n**Relationship**: Fare = 100 × Distance\n\n**Worked Example**:\n- 5 km trip costs: Fare = 100 × 5 = ₦500\n- 15 km trip costs: Fare = 100 × 15 = ₦1,500\n- 25 km trip costs: Fare = 100 × 25 = ₦2,500\n\n**Pattern**: Fare varies directly with distance (k = 100)\n\n### Finding the Constant\n**If y varies directly with x**, and y = 20 when x = 4:\n\n- y = kx\n- 20 = k(4)\n- k = 5\n\n**So equation is y = 5x**\n\n## Part 2: Inverse Variation\n\n### Definition\ny varies inversely with x means: y = k/x\n\nwhere k is the constant.\n\n**Property**: When x increases, y decreases.\n\n### Nigerian Example 2: Workers and Project Time\nBuilding a 100 m² house requires 1,000 man-hours of work.\n\n**If 10 workers work on the project**:\n- Time = 1,000/10 = 100 hours each\n- Total time: 100 hours\n\n**If 20 workers work on project**:\n- Time = 1,000/20 = 50 hours each\n- Total time: 50 hours\n\n**Pattern**: More workers → less time (inverse variation, k = 1,000)\n\n### Worked Example: Supplies Management\nA delivery driver uses fuel inversely proportional to remaining supplies. With 500 liters fuel, can cover 2,000 km (k = 500 × 2,000 = 1,000,000).\n\n**How far with 250 liters**?\n- Distance = 1,000,000/250\n- Distance = **4,000 km** ✓\n\n## Part 3: Joint Variation\n\n### Definition\nz varies jointly with x and y means: z = kxy\n\n**Property**: z changes with changes in both x and y.\n\n### Nigerian Example 3: Farm Harvest\nCrop yield depends on fertilizer AND rainfall.\n\n**Formula**: Yield = k × Fertilizer × Rainfall\n\nIf k = 50 (kg yield per unit fertilizer per unit rainfall):\n- With 100 units fertilizer and 500 mm rainfall:\n  Yield = 50 × 100 × 500 = 2,500,000 kg\n\n- With 100 units fertilizer and 300 mm rainfall (less rain):\n  Yield = 50 × 100 × 300 = 1,500,000 kg\n\n**Both factors matter for maximum yield**\n\n## Part 4: Partial Variation\n\n### Definition\ny partially varies with x when: y = a + kx\n\n**Property**: y has a fixed component (a) plus variable component (kx)\n\n### Nigerian Example 4: NEPA Electricity Billing\nBill = Base fee + Usage charge\nBill = 1,000 + 68 × kWh\n\n**If use 500 kWh**:\n- Bill = 1,000 + 68 × 500\n- Bill = 1,000 + 34,000\n- **Bill = ₦35,000**\n\n**If use 200 kWh**:\n- Bill = 1,000 + 68 × 200\n- Bill = 1,000 + 13,600\n- **Bill = ₦14,600**\n\n**Pattern**: Even with 0 kWh, you pay ₦1,000 base fee\n\n## Part 5: Complex Variation Problems\n\n### Worked Example 1: Transport Cost Analysis\nA hauling company charges: Cost = Base + (Distance × Rate) + (Weight × Factor)\n\n**Cost = 5,000 + 100D + 50W**\n\nwhere D = distance (km), W = weight (tonnes)\n\n**For 100 km trip with 5 tonnes**:\n- Cost = 5,000 + 100(100) + 50(5)\n- Cost = 5,000 + 10,000 + 250\n- **Cost = ₦15,250**\n\n### Worked Example 2: Dangote Cement Production\nProduction depends on workers (W) and machines (M):\n\n**Production = 10 × W × M**\n\n(10 bags per worker-machine unit per day)\n\n**With 50 workers and 10 machines**:\n- Production = 10 × 50 × 10 = 5,000 bags/day\n\n**To increase to 10,000 bags/day**, double either:\n- Option A: 100 workers + 10 machines\n- Option B: 50 workers + 20 machines\n\n## Part 6: Real Nigerian Applications\n\n### Market Trading\nPrice inversely varies with abundance:\n- When tomatoes abundant, price low (₦50/kg)\n- When tomatoes scarce, price high (₦300/kg)\n- **Equation**: Price × Quantity = constant\n\n### Manufacturing\nOutput directly varies with:\n- Number of machines (more machines = more output)\n- Worker skill (trained workers = more output)\n- **Formula**: Output = k × Machines × Skill level\n\n### Transportation Network\nDelivery time partially varies:\n- **Time = Fixed + Distance/Speed**\n- Fixed time: Vehicle prep, paperwork (1 hour)\n- Variable time: Distance/Speed\n\n**Lagos to Ibadan (120 km, average 60 km/h)**:\n- Time = 1 + 120/60 = 1 + 2 = 3 hours\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Identify variation type**: Read problem carefully (direct, inverse, or joint)\n2. **Find constant first**: Use given values to calculate k\n3. **Write equation clearly**: State y = kx before solving\n4. **Substitute completely**: Replace all variables with numbers\n5. **Check units**: Include units in final answer\n6. **Reasonableness test**: Does answer make sense?\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: y varies directly with x. If y = 30 when x = 6, find y when x = 10.\n\n**Problem 2**: m varies inversely with n. If m = 20 when n = 5, find m when n = 2.\n\n**Problem 3**: z varies jointly with x and y. If z = 60 when x = 3 and y = 4, find z when x = 2 and y = 5.\n\n**Problem 4**: Monthly rent = ₦50,000 + ₦500/m² × area. Find rent for 100 m² apartment.\n\n## Key Formulas\n\n- **Direct**: y = kx\n- **Inverse**: y = k/x\n- **Joint**: z = kxy\n- **Partial**: y = a + kx\n\n## Nigerian Context Importance\n\nVariation helps predict and plan:\n- **Transportation**: Calculate fares, delivery times\n- **Commerce**: Price-supply relationships, profit margins\n- **Manufacturing**: Production planning with resources\n- **Agriculture**: Yield predictions with inputs\n- **Utilities**: Calculate bills (NEPA, water, internet)\n- **Business**: Cost analysis, pricing strategies\n\nThis mathematical tool directly applies to Nigerian daily commerce and planning!\n",

Bank savings grow in geometric progression (compound interest). Property prices in Lagos increase in arithmetic progression. Civil servant salaries follow predictable sequences. Understanding sequences and series unlocks the mathematics of growth, investment, and planning.\n\n## Part 1: Arithmetic Progression (AP)\n\n### Definition\nAn Arithmetic Progression is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\n\n**Form**: a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ...\n\n**Examples**:\n- 2, 5, 8, 11, ... (first term a=2, common difference d=3)\n- 100, 95, 90, 85, ...

Find total profit in 12 months.\n\n**Problem 2**: UBA offers 8% compound interest on savings. If ₦500,000 is invested, find amount after 3 years.\n\n**Problem 3**: An AP has first term 5 and common difference 3. Find the sum of first 20 terms.\n\n**Problem 4**: A GP has first term 2 and common ratio 3.

      "content": "\n# Temperature and Heat: From Lagos Climate to Nigerian Kitchens\n\n## Introduction\nEvery Nigerian experiences temperature daily: Lagos heat at 27°C, Jos coolness at 20°C, Sokoto's blazing 42°C. Food cooks at precise temperatures, vaccines need cold storage, and electricity consumption depends on climate. Understanding temperature and heat is essential for daily life in Nigeria.\n\n## Part 1: Temperature Scales\n\n### Celsius Scale\nMost common in Nigeria. Based on water freezing (0°C) and boiling (100°C) at sea level.\n\n**Nigerian Temperature Examples**:\n- Lagos average: 27°C (warm year-round)\n- Jos Plateau: 20°C (cooler highland)\n- Sokoto dry season: 42°C (very hot)\n- Cool room: 16°C\n- Normal body: 37°C\n- Fever: 39-40°C\n\n### Fahrenheit Scale\nUsed in some medical contexts and old British instruments.\n\n**Conversion**:\n- F = 9/5 × C + 32\n- C = 5/9 × (F - 32)\n\n**Worked Example 1: Lagos Temperature Conversion**\nLagos average is 27°C. Convert to Fahrenheit.\n- F = 9/5 × 27 + 32\n- F = 48.6 + 32\n- **F = 80.6°F** (warm and comfortable)\n\n### Kelvin Scale\nAbsolute temperature scale. K = C + 273 (or C + 273.15 precisely)\n\n**Nigerian temperatures in Kelvin**:\n- Lagos 27°C = 300 K\n- Jos 20°C = 293 K\n- Sokoto 42°C = 315 K\n\n**WAEC Tip**: Always convert to Kelvin for gas law calculations!\n\n## Part 2: Heat Capacity and Specific Heat Capacity\n\n### Heat Capacity (C)\nEnergy needed to raise 1 object by 1°C.\n\n**Formula**: Q = C × ΔT\n\nwhere:\n- Q = heat energy (joules)\n- C = heat capacity (J/°C)\n- ΔT = temperature change (°C)\n\n### Specific Heat Capacity (c)\nEnergy needed to raise 1 kg of substance by 1°C.\n\n**Formula**: Q = m × c × ΔT\n\n**Worked Example 2: Heating Nigerian Soup**\nA pot of vegetable soup (5 kg) needs heating from 25°C to 95°C.\n\n**Given**:\n- Mass m = 5 kg\n- Temperature change: ΔT = 95 - 25 = 70°C\n- Specific heat of water (main component): c = 4,200 J/kg°C\n\n**Solution**:\n- Q = m × c × ΔT\n- Q = 5 × 4,200 × 70\n- Q = 1,470,000 J = **1.47 MJ**\n\n**Meaning**: Need 1.47 million joules of energy to heat the soup.\n\n**Nigerian context**: A gas stove releases ~30 MJ per hour, so this takes ~3 minutes.\n\n### Specific Heat Values (Common Nigerian Materials)\n| Material | Specific Heat (J/kg°C) |\n|----------|----------------------|\n| Water | 4,200 |\n| Cooking oil | 2,000 |\n| Sand (Sahara) | 800 |\n| Iron (cookware) | 450 |\n| Aluminum | 900 |\n\n## Part 3: Latent Heat\n\n### Latent Heat of Fusion (Melting)\nEnergy needed to melt solid without temperature change.\n\n**Formula**: Q = m × Lf\n\n- Ice: Lf = 334,000 J/kg\n- Energy to melt 1 kg ice = 334 kJ\n\n### Latent Heat of Vaporization (Boiling)\nEnergy needed to convert liquid to gas without temperature change.\n\n**Formula**: Q = m × Lv\n\n- Water: Lv = 2,260,000 J/kg (2.26 MJ)\n- Energy to boil 1 kg water = 2,260 kJ\n\n**Worked Example 3: Boiling Water for Pap**\nHeating 2 kg water from 25°C to boiling (100°C), then completely boiling it.\n\n**Step 1 - Heating**:\n- Q₁ = m × c × ΔT\n- Q₁ = 2 × 4,200 × 75\n- Q₁ = 630,000 J\n\n**Step 2 - Boiling (vaporization)**:\n- Q₂ = m × Lv\n- Q₂ = 2 × 2,260,000\n- Q₂ = 4,520,000 J\n\n**Total energy**:\n- Q_total = 630,000 + 4,520,000 = **5,150,000 J = 5.15 MJ**\n\n**Meaning**: Mostly goes to vaporization, not heating!\n\n## Part 4: Heat Transfer Methods\n\n### Conduction\nDirect transfer through material (no movement).\n\n**Nigerian Example**: Metal pot conducting heat to food inside.\n- Aluminum pot conducts heat quickly (high conductivity)\n- Traditional clay pots conduct slowly\n\n**Application**: Choose materials wisely for cooking efficiency!\n\n### Convection\nTransfer through movement of liquid/gas.\n\n**Nigerian Example**: Hot water in soup rising, cold sinking.\n- Creates circular motion\n- Distributes heat throughout\n\n**Application**: Stir soup for even heating (stronger convection).\n\n### Radiation\nTransfer through electromagnetic waves (no contact needed).\n\n**Nigerian Example**: Nigerian sun warming Lagos without touching.\n- Infrared radiation heats skin, buildings\n- Solar panels use this to generate electricity (Kaduna installations)\n\n## Part 5: Real Nigerian Heat Applications\n\n### Air Conditioning Load (Lagos)\nTo keep room at 22°C when outside is 32°C:\n\n**Heat entering** ≈ Building surface area × Temperature difference × U-value\n\nModern Lagos office building (500 m²) requires:\n- Cooling capacity: ~60 kW\n- Cost: ₦50,000/month electricity (NEPA rate)\n\n### Cooking Efficiency\nGas stove (~10 kW) vs electric kettle (2 kW):\n- **Gas**: Heats water in 5 minutes (efficient, cheaper)\n- **Electric**: Heats water in 10 minutes (less efficient, more expensive)\n\n**Cost comparison**:\n- Gas: 1 liter water = ₦50 cost\n- Electricity: 1 liter water = ₦120 cost (2.4× more expensive)\n\n### Vaccine Cold Chain\nPfizer vaccine storage: 2-8°C required.\n\n**Cooling needed**: Remove heat to maintain low temperature.\n- Nigerian cold store in Lagos: ₦5M system\n- Running cost: ₦100,000/month electricity\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Check temperature units**: Problem might be in K, not °C\n2. **Include latent heat**: Don't forget vaporization/fusion energy\n3. **Show all steps**: Heating then boiling (two separate processes)\n4. **State formula first**: Write Q = mc∆T before substituting\n5. **Use correct c value**: Different materials have different specific heat\n6. **Units matter**: Answer in joules, always\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: Convert 40°C to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.\n\n**Problem 2**: How much energy to heat 10 kg iron from 20°C to 100°C? (c = 450 J/kg°C)\n\n**Problem 3**: How much energy to melt 5 kg ice at 0°C? (Lf = 334,000 J/kg)\n\n**Problem 4**: A Lagos building loses 100 kJ heat per minute. How long for 5 MJ loss?\n\n## Key Equations\n\n- **Conversion**: F = 9/5C + 32, K = C + 273\n- **Heat capacity**: Q = mc∆T\n- **Latent heat**: Q = mL\n- **Total thermal energy**: Q_total = mc∆T + mL\n\n## Nigerian Context Importance\n\nTemperature and heat knowledge helps with:\n- **Cooking**: Efficient food preparation (gas vs electric)\n- **Climate**: Adapt to Lagos heat or Jos coolness\n- **Health**: Fever understanding, vaccine storage\n- **Business**: AC costs, refrigeration, solar thermal\n- **Energy**: Electricity consumption, efficiency improvements\n- **Construction**: Thermal insulation design\n\nThis knowledge makes Nigerian daily life more efficient and economical!\n",

Understanding variation unlocks prediction and planning in Nigerian life.\n\n## Part 1: Direct Variation\n\n### Definition\ny varies directly with x means: y = kx\n\nwhere k is the constant of variation.\n\n**Property**: When x increases, y increases proportionally.\n\n### Nigerian Example 1: Taxi Fares in Lagos\nTypical rate: ₦100 per kilometer\n\n**Relationship**: Fare = 100 × Distance\n\n**Worked Example**:\n- 5 km trip costs: Fare = 100 × 5 = ₦500\n- 15 km trip costs: Fare = 100 × 15 = ₦1,500\n- 25 km trip costs: Fare = 100 × 25 = ₦2,500\n\n**Pattern**: Fare varies directly with distance (k = 100)\n\n### Finding the Constant\n**If y varies directly with x**, and y = 20 when x = 4:\n\n- y = kx\n- 20 = k(4)\n- k = 5\n\n**So equation is y = 5x**\n\n## Part 2: Inverse Variation\n\n### Definition\ny varies inversely with x means: y = k/x\n\nwhere k is the constant.\n\n**Property**: When x increases, y decreases.\n\n### Nigerian Example 2: Workers and Project Time\nBuilding a 100 m² house requires 1,000 man-hours of work.\n\n**If 10 workers work on the project**:\n- Time = 1,000/10 = 100 hours each\n- Total time: 100 hours\n\n**If 20 workers work on project**:\n- Time = 1,000/20 = 50 hours each\n- Total time: 50 hours\n\n**Pattern**: More workers → less time (inverse variation, k = 1,000)\n\n### Worked Example: Supplies Management\nA delivery driver uses fuel inversely proportional to remaining supplies. With 500 liters fuel, can cover 2,000 km (k = 500 × 2,000 = 1,000,000).\n\n**How far with 250 liters**?\n- Distance = 1,000,000/250\n- Distance = **4,000 km** ✓\n\n## Part 3: Joint Variation\n\n### Definition\nz varies jointly with x and y means: z = kxy\n\n**Property**: z changes with changes in both x and y.\n\n### Nigerian Example 3: Farm Harvest\nCrop yield depends on fertilizer AND rainfall.\n\n**Formula**: Yield = k × Fertilizer × Rainfall\n\nIf k = 50 (kg yield per unit fertilizer per unit rainfall):\n- With 100 units fertilizer and 500 mm rainfall:\n  Yield = 50 × 100 × 500 = 2,500,000 kg\n\n- With 100 units fertilizer and 300 mm rainfall (less rain):\n  Yield = 50 × 100 × 300 = 1,500,000 kg\n\n**Both factors matter for maximum yield**\n\n## Part 4: Partial Variation\n\n### Definition\ny partially varies with x when: y = a + kx\n\n**Property**: y has a fixed component (a) plus variable component (kx)\n\n### Nigerian Example 4: NEPA Electricity Billing\nBill = Base fee + Usage charge\nBill = 1,000 + 68 × kWh\n\n**If use 500 kWh**:\n- Bill = 1,000 + 68 × 500\n- Bill = 1,000 + 34,000\n- **Bill = ₦35,000**\n\n**If use 200 kWh**:\n- Bill = 1,000 + 68 × 200\n- Bill = 1,000 + 13,600\n- **Bill = ₦14,600**\n\n**Pattern**: Even with 0 kWh, you pay ₦1,000 base fee\n\n## Part 5: Complex Variation Problems\n\n### Worked Example 1: Transport Cost Analysis\nA hauling company charges: Cost = Base + (Distance × Rate) + (Weight × Factor)\n\n**Cost = 5,000 + 100D + 50W**\n\nwhere D = distance (km), W = weight (tonnes)\n\n**For 100 km trip with 5 tonnes**:\n- Cost = 5,000 + 100(100) + 50(5)\n- Cost = 5,000 + 10,000 + 250\n- **Cost = ₦15,250**\n\n### Worked Example 2: Dangote Cement Production\nProduction depends on workers (W) and machines (M):\n\n**Production = 10 × W × M**\n\n(10 bags per worker-machine unit per day)\n\n**With 50 workers and 10 machines**:\n- Production = 10 × 50 × 10 = 5,000 bags/day\n\n**To increase to 10,000 bags/day**, double either:\n- Option A: 100 workers + 10 machines\n- Option B: 50 workers + 20 machines\n\n## Part 6: Real Nigerian Applications\n\n### Market Trading\nPrice inversely varies with abundance:\n- When tomatoes abundant, price low (₦50/kg)\n- When tomatoes scarce, price high (₦300/kg)\n- **Equation**: Price × Quantity = constant\n\n### Manufacturing\nOutput directly varies with:\n- Number of machines (more machines = more output)\n- Worker skill (trained workers = more output)\n- **Formula**: Output = k × Machines × Skill level\n\n### Transportation Network\nDelivery time partially varies:\n- **Time = Fixed + Distance/Speed**\n- Fixed time: Vehicle prep, paperwork (1 hour)\n- Variable time: Distance/Speed\n\n**Lagos to Ibadan (120 km, average 60 km/h)**:\n- Time = 1 + 120/60 = 1 + 2 = 3 hours\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Identify variation type**: Read problem carefully (direct, inverse, or joint)\n2. **Find constant first**: Use given values to calculate k\n3. **Write equation clearly**: State y = kx before solving\n4. **Substitute completely**: Replace all variables with numbers\n5. **Check units**: Include units in final answer\n6. **Reasonableness test**: Does answer make sense?\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: y varies directly with x. If y = 30 when x = 6, find y when x = 10.\n\n**Problem 2**: m varies inversely with n. If m = 20 when n = 5, find m when n = 2.\n\n**Problem 3**: z varies jointly with x and y. If z = 60 when x = 3 and y = 4, find z when x = 2 and y = 5.\n\n**Problem 4**: Monthly rent = ₦50,000 + ₦500/m² × area. Find rent for 100 m² apartment.\n\n## Key Formulas\n\n- **Direct**: y = kx\n- **Inverse**: y = k/x\n- **Joint**: z = kxy\n- **Partial**: y = a + kx\n\n## Nigerian Context Importance\n\nVariation helps predict and plan:\n- **Transportation**: Calculate fares, delivery times\n- **Commerce**: Price-supply relationships, profit margins\n- **Manufacturing**: Production planning with resources\n- **Agriculture**: Yield predictions with inputs\n- **Utilities**: Calculate bills (NEPA, water, internet)\n- **Business**: Cost analysis, pricing strategies\n\nThis mathematical tool directly applies to Nigerian daily commerce and planning!\n",

Land surveyors use triangulation to measure property boundaries. Traditional Yoruba geometric patterns display mathematical precision. Understanding angles and triangles is essential for Nigerian architecture, engineering, and surveying.\n\n## Part 1: Angles in Polygons\n\n### Interior Angle Sum\nFor a polygon with n sides:\n\n**Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) × 180°**\n\n### Nigerian Example 1: Abuja Building Designs\nA hexagonal (6-sided) office building common in Abuja.\n\n**Interior angle sum**:\n- Sum = (6 - 2) × 180°\n- Sum = 4 × 180°\n- Sum = **720°**\n\n**Each angle (regular hexagon)**:\n- Each angle = 720°/6 = **120°**\n\n### Exterior Angles\n**Sum of exterior angles = 360°** (always)\n\nFor regular polygon:\n- Each exterior angle = 360°/n\n\n**Regular hexagon exterior angle**:\n- 360°/6 = **60°**\n\n**WAEC Tip**: Exterior angles always sum to 360° regardless of polygon shape!\n\n## Part 2: Triangle Properties\n\n### Triangle Angle Sum\nAll triangles: **∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°**\n\n### Triangle Types\n- **Acute**: All angles < 90°\n- **Right**: One angle = 90°\n- **Obtuse**: One angle > 90°\n- **Equilateral**: All angles = 60°\n- **Isosceles**: Two equal angles\n- **Scalene**: All different angles\n\n### Worked Example 1: Roof Truss Design\nA Nigerian roof truss forms triangle with:\n- ∠A = 35°\n- ∠B = 65°\n- ∠C = ?\n\n**Solution**:\n- ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°\n- 35° + 65° + ∠C = 180°\n- ∠C = **80°**\n\n## Part 3: Similar Triangles\n\n### Definition\nTriangles are similar if:\n- All corresponding angles equal\n- All corresponding sides proportional\n\n### Nigerian Example 2: Shadow Measurement\nAso Rock in Abuja casts shadow. Using small triangle, we measure:\n\n**Small triangle**:\n- Height of stick: 2 m\n- Shadow: 1.5 m\n\n**Large triangle**:\n- Aso Rock shadow: 300 m\n- Height: ?\n\n**Since triangles are similar**:\n- 2/1.5 = Height/300\n- Height = 2 × 300/1.5\n- Height = 600/1.5\n- **Height = 400 m**\n\n(Note: Actual Aso Rock height is 256 m, accounting for angle differences)\n\n## Part 4: Pythagoras Theorem\n\n### Formula\nFor right triangle: **a² + b² = c²**\n\nwhere c is hypotenuse (longest side).\n\n### Nigerian Example 3: Land Plot Measurement\nA triangular Lagos property plot:\n- Two sides: 80 m and 60 m\n- These are perpendicular (right angle between them)\n- Third side (diagonal): ?\n\n**Solution**:\n- a² + b² = c²\n- 80² + 60² = c²\n- 6,400 + 3,600 = c²\n- 10,000 = c²\n- c = **100 m**\n\n**Common Pythagorean triples in Nigeria**:\n- 3-4-5 (scaling: 30-40-50, 60-80-100)\n- 5-12-13\n- 8-15-17\n\n### Worked Example: Niger Bridge Measurement\nA bridge support triangle:\n- Height: 50 m\n- Base: 120 m\n- Slant length: ?\n\n**Solution**:\n- 50² + 120² = c²\n- 2,500 + 14,400 = c²\n- 16,900 = c²\n- c = **130 m**\n\n## Part 5: Congruent Triangles\n\n### Conditions for Congruence\n1. **SSS** (Side-Side-Side): All three sides equal\n2. **SAS** (Side-Angle-Side): Two sides and included angle equal\n3. **ASA** (Angle-Side-Angle): Two angles and included side equal\n4. **RHS** (Right-Hypotenuse-Side): Right angle, hypotenuse, and one side equal\n\n### Nigerian Example 4: Identical Roof Trusses\nTwo roof trusses must be congruent:\n- First truss: sides 5 m, 6 m, 7 m\n- Second truss: sides 5 m, 6 m, 7 m\n\n**By SSS**: Trusses are congruent ✓ (identical shapes, sizes)\n\n## Part 6: Real Nigerian Applications\n\n### Land Surveying\nProperty boundaries often use triangulation:\n- Surveyor measures baseline (100 m)\n- Measures angles to boundary corners (45° and 75°)\n- Calculates property perimeter and area\n\n### Construction\nRoof trusses use 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangles:\n- **45-45-90**: Isosceles, sides ratio 1:1:√2\n- **30-60-90**: Sides ratio 1:√3:2\n\n### Architecture\nNigerian traditional patterns use:\n- Equilateral triangles (Igbo crafts)\n- Isosceles triangles (Hausa designs)\n- Right triangles (building foundations)\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Draw diagrams**: Always sketch the triangle first\n2. **Label clearly**: Mark all angles and sides\n3. **State theorem**: Write \"By Pythagoras theorem...\" before using\n4. **Check angle sum**: Verify angles add to 180°\n5. **Similar triangles**: Establish correspondence clearly\n6. **Units matter**: Include m, cm, degrees in answer\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: Pentagon (5 sides) interior angle sum = ?\n\n**Problem 2**: Right triangle has sides 3 cm and 4 cm. Hypotenuse = ?\n\n**Problem 3**: Two similar triangles have corresponding sides 4 cm and 6 cm. If first triangle's perimeter is 12 cm, find second triangle's perimeter.\n\n**Problem 4**: Triangle angles are x, 2x, and 3x. Find x.\n\n## Key Formulas\n\n- **Polygon angle sum**: (n-2) × 180°\n- **Exterior angle sum**: 360°\n- **Triangle angle sum**: 180°\n- **Pythagoras**: a² + b² = c²\n\n## Nigerian Context Importance\n\nTriangle geometry applies to:\n- **Construction**: Building design, roof truss angles\n- **Surveying**: Property boundary measurement\n- **Engineering**: Bridge support structures\n- **Land measurement**: Triangulation for area calculation\n- **Architecture**: Traditional pattern design\n- **Arts**: Textile and craft geometric designs\n\nThis foundational geometry enables accurate Nigerian construction and measurement!\n",
