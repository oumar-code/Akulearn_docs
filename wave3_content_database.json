With the advent of computers and the internet, students now have access to vast amounts of information. Online learning platforms allow flexible study schedules, and digital textbooks reduce the cost of education. However, challenges remain, including unreliable electricity and limited internet access in rural areas.\n\nDespite these obstacles, technology continues to transform Nigerian education. Mobile learning apps provide interactive lessons, and video conferencing enables remote teaching. As infrastructure improves, technology will play an even greater role in democratizing education across the country.\n\n## Practice Questions\n\n1. What is the main idea of the passage?\n2. What challenges does the author mention regarding technology in Nigerian education?\n3. What benefits of technology are discussed?\n4.

It deals with the relationships between heat, work, and other forms of energy. Understanding thermodynamics is essential for engines, refrigerators, and many industrial processes.\n\n## Temperature and Heat\n\n### Temperature\nMeasure of hotness or coldness of a body.\n\n### Heat\nEnergy transferred due to temperature difference.\n\n### Units\n- Temperature: Celsius (°C), Kelvin (K), Fahrenheit (°F)\n- Heat: Joule (J), calorie (cal)\n- 1 cal = 4.184 J\n\n### Temperature Conversion\n- °C to K: T(K) = T(°C) + 273\n- °F to °C: T(°C) = (T(°F) - 32) * 5/9\n\n## Thermal Expansion\n\n### Linear Expansion\n**Formula:** ΔL = L₀ α ΔT\n- ΔL: change in length\n- L₀: original length\n- α: linear expansion coefficient\n- ΔT: temperature change\n\n### Area Expansion\n**Formula:** ΔA = A₀ β ΔT\n- β = 2α (for most materials)\n\n### Volume Expansion\n**Formula:** ΔV = V₀ γ ΔT\n- γ = 3α (for most materials)\n\n### Applications\n- Bimetallic strips in thermostats\n- Railway tracks expansion joints\n- Glassware in laboratories\n\n## Heat Transfer\n\n### Conduction\nTransfer of heat through direct contact.\n\n**Formula:** Q = (kAΔT)/d * t\n- k: thermal conductivity\n- A: area\n- ΔT: temperature difference\n- d: thickness\n- t: time\n\n### Convection\nTransfer of heat by movement of fluid.\n\n#### Natural Convection\nDue to density differences (hot air rises)\n\n#### Forced Convection\nDue to external force (fans, pumps)\n\n### Radiation\nTransfer of heat by electromagnetic waves.\n\n**Formula:** Q = σAT⁴\n- σ: Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 * 10^-8 W/m²K⁴)\n- A: surface area\n- T: absolute temperature\n\n## Specific Heat Capacity\n\n### Definition\nHeat required to raise temperature of 1kg substance by 1K.\n\n**Formula:** Q = mcΔT\n- Q: heat energy (J)\n- m: mass (kg)\n- c: specific heat capacity (J/kgK)\n- ΔT: temperature change (K)\n\n### Water Equivalent\nMass of water that would absorb same heat as the substance.\n\n## Latent Heat\n\n### Latent Heat of Fusion\nHeat required to change 1kg solid to liquid at melting point.\n\n### Latent Heat of Vaporization\nHeat required to change 1kg liquid to vapor at boiling point.\n\n**Formula:** Q = mL\n- L: latent heat (J/kg)\n\n## First Law of Thermodynamics\n\n### Statement\nEnergy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.\n\n**Equation:** ΔU = Q - W\n- ΔU: change in internal energy\n- Q: heat added to system\n- W: work done by system\n\n### Sign Conventions\n- Q positive: heat added to system\n- Q negative: heat removed from system\n- W positive: work done by system\n- W negative: work done on system\n\n## Heat Engines\n\n### Efficiency\nRatio of work output to heat input.\n\n**Formula:** η = W/Q₁ = 1 - (Q₂/Q₁)\n- W: work done\n- Q₁: heat input\n- Q₂: heat rejected\n\n### Carnot Engine\nTheoretical maximum efficiency.\n\n**Formula:** η = 1 - (T₂/T₁)\n- T₁: hot reservoir temperature\n- T₂: cold reservoir temperature\n\n## Refrigerators and Heat Pumps\n\n### Coefficient of Performance (COP)\n**Formula:** COP = Q₂/W = T₂/(T₁ - T₂)\n- Q₂: heat extracted from cold reservoir\n- W: work input\n- T₁, T₂: temperatures\n\n## Nigerian Applications\n\n### Petroleum Industry\n- Oil refining processes\n- Heat exchangers in refineries\n- Pipeline temperature control\n- Storage tank insulation\n\n### Agriculture\n- Food preservation and refrigeration\n- Greenhouse temperature control\n- Crop drying processes\n- Cold storage facilities\n\n### Manufacturing\n- Metal working and forging\n- Plastic molding processes\n- Textile dyeing and finishing\n- Cement production\n\n### Domestic Applications\n- Cooking and food preparation\n- Water heating systems\n- Air conditioning\n- Refrigeration appliances\n\n### Power Generation\n- Thermal power plants\n- Geothermal energy exploration\n- Solar thermal systems\n- Waste heat recovery\n\n## Climate and Weather\n\n### Greenhouse Effect\n- Atmospheric heat trapping\n- Global warming implications\n- Nigerian climate patterns\n- Desertification in northern Nigeria\n\n### Urban Heat Islands\n- Temperature differences in cities\n- Lagos heat island effect\n- Urban planning considerations\n\n## Common Mistakes\n- Confusing heat and temperature\n- Wrong sign conventions in thermodynamics\n- Incorrect unit conversions\n- Misunderstanding heat transfer mechanisms\n- Wrong efficiency calculations\n\n## Practice Problems\n1.
