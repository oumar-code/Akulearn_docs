## What are Linear Equations?

A linear equation is an equation that makes a straight line when it is graphed. It has the general form:

**ax + b = c**

Where:
- **a** is the coefficient of x
- **b** is the constant term
- **c** is the constant on the other side

## Solving Linear Equations

### Addition and Subtraction
To solve equations, perform the same operation on both sides.

**Example:** x + 5 = 12
**Solution:** x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5
**Result:** x = 7

### Multiplication and Division
**Example:** 3x = 15
**Solution:** 3x ÷ 3 = 15 ÷ 3
**Result:** x = 5

## Applications

Linear equations are used in:
- Business (profit calculations)
- Physics (distance-speed-time)
- Engineering (load calculations)
- Finance (interest calculations),15,basic_algebra,waec_math_2020_q1,linear_equations,algebra,Mathematics Expert

## Newton's Laws of Motion

### First Law (Law of Inertia)
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

### Second Law (F = ma)
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

**Formula:** F = ma
- F = force (Newtons)
- m = mass (kg)
- a = acceleration (m/s²)

### Third Law (Action-Reaction)
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

## Key Formulas

| Concept | Formula | Units |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Speed | v = d/t | m/s |
| Acceleration | a = (v-u)/t | m/s² |
| Force | F = ma | N |
| Weight | W = mg | N |
| Work | W = Fd cosθ | J |

## Common Misconceptions

- **Heavy objects fall faster:** All objects fall at the same rate in vacuum
- **Force equals weight:** Weight is a type of force, but not all forces are weight
- **Inertia means laziness:** Inertia is resistance to change in motion, not reluctance to work,12,,waec_physics_2020_q3,mechanics,newton,laws,Physics Expert
Periodic Table Fundamentals,Chemistry,Periodic Table,summary,basic,WAEC,# The Periodic Table

## Organization

The periodic table organizes elements by:
- **Atomic number** (number of protons)
- **Groups** (vertical columns, similar properties)
- **Periods** (horizontal rows, same electron shell level)

## Group Characteristics

### Group 1: Alkali Metals
- Soft, reactive metals
- React violently with water
- Examples: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs

### Group 7: Halogens
- Reactive non-metals
- Form salts with metals
- Examples: F, Cl, Br, I

### Group 8: Noble Gases
- Unreactive gases
- Full outer electron shells
- Examples: He, Ne, Ar, Kr

## Periodic Trends

### Atomic Radius
- **Decreases** across a period (left to right)
- **Increases** down a group

### Ionization Energy
- **Increases** across a period
- **Decreases** down a group

### Electronegativity
- **Increases** across a period
- **Decreases** down a group

## Element Classification

### Metals
- Left side of table
- Good conductors
- Malleable and ductile

### Non-metals
- Right side of table
- Poor conductors
- Brittle solids or gases

### Metalloids
- Between metals and non-metals
- Semiconductor properties
- Examples: B, Si, Ge, As

## Exam Focus Areas

- Group properties and reactions
- Periodic trends explanations
- Element identification
- Electronic configuration patterns,10,,waec_chemistry_2020_q2,periodic_table,elements,trends,Chemistry Expert
Cell Structure and Function,Biology,Cell Biology,summary,basic,WAEC,# Cell Biology Fundamentals

## Cell Theory

1. All living organisms are composed of cells
2. The cell is the basic unit of life
3. All cells come from pre-existing cells

## Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells

| Feature | Prokaryotic | Eukaryotic |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Nucleus | Absent | Present |
| Size | Smaller (1-10 μm) | Larger (10-100 μm) |
| Organelles | No membrane-bound | Membrane-bound |
| Examples | Bacteria | Plants, animals, fungi |

## Cell Organelles

### Membrane-bound Organelles
- **Nucleus:** Control center, contains DNA
- **Mitochondria:** Energy production (ATP)
- **Endoplasmic Reticulum:** Protein synthesis and transport
- **Golgi Apparatus:** Packaging and modification
- **Lysosomes:** Digestion and waste removal
- **Vacuoles:** Storage (large in plant cells)

### Other Structures
- **Ribosomes:** Protein synthesis
- **Cell Membrane:** Controls substance movement
- **Cell Wall:** Support and protection (plants)

## Plant vs Animal Cells

### Plant Cells Have:
- Cell wall (cellulose)
- Large central vacuole
- Chloroplasts (photosynthesis)
- No centrioles

### Animal Cells Have:
- Centrioles (cell division)
- Lysosomes
- No cell wall
- Smaller vacuoles

## Cell Membrane Structure

- **Phospholipid bilayer** with embedded proteins
- **Selectively permeable**
- **Fluid mosaic model**
- Controls movement of substances in/out of cell

## Cell Division

### Mitosis
- Produces identical daughter cells
- Growth and repair
- Single division

### Meiosis
- Produces gametes (sperm/eggs)
- Genetic variation
- Two divisions (meiosis I and II),8,,waec_biology_2020_q1,cell_biology,organelles,structure,Biology Expert
