## Agricultural Principles

### Soil Science
- **Soil formation:** Weathering of bedrock over centuries
- **Horizons:** O (organic), A (topsoil), B (subsoil), C (bedrock)
- **Nigerian soils:** Ferruginous tropical soils, high clay content
- **Fertility:** Topsoil contains most organic matter and nutrients
- **Erosion concern:** Loss of topsoil = loss of productivity

### Crop Production
- **Growth stages:**
  1. Germination (3-7 days)
  2. Seedling (7-21 days)
  3. Vegetative (21-60 days)
  4. Reproductive (60-90 days)
  5. Maturity (90-120 days)
- **Management:** Different inputs needed at each stage
- **Nigerian crops:** Maize, rice, cassava, yam, sorghum, millet

### Livestock Management
- **Ruminants (cow, goat):** Four-stomach system, can digest cellulose
  - Rumen: Microbial fermentation
  - Allows grazing on grass/hay
- **Monogastric (chicken):** Single stomach
  - Crop: Temporary food storage
  - Gizzard: Mechanical grinding with grit
  - Requires concentrated feed
- **Feed conversion:** Ruminants slower but can use marginal lands

### Farm Tools
- **Hoe:** Most common Nigerian farm tool, hand-powered
- **Cutlass:** Multipurpose clearing and harvesting
- **Plough:** Animal or tractor-drawn, deeper tillage
- **Harrow:** Breaks clods after ploughing, prepares seedbed
- **Mechanization:** Increases efficiency but requires capital

### Irrigation Methods
- **Drip:** 90-95% efficiency, water directly to roots, expensive
- **Sprinkler:** 70-85% efficiency, overhead spray, moderate cost
- **Surface:** 40-60% efficiency, flood/furrow, cheap but wasteful
- **Nigerian context:** Most farming is rain-fed, dry season irrigation crucial for second crop

### Greenhouse Technology
- **Advantages:**
  - Protection from pests and weather
  - Extended growing season
  - Higher yields per area
  - Premium pricing for off-season produce
- **Challenges:**
  - High initial cost
  - Electricity for cooling in Nigeria's climate
  - Technical knowledge required
- **Potential:** Urban agriculture, export crops
