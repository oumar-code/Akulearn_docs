## Content


### 1.1: Ancient Nigeria and Early Settlements

*Duration: 20 minutes*

Early settlements grew around rivers (Niger, Benue) and fertile lands. Nok culture (c. 1000 BC–300 AD) known for terracotta, early iron smelting. Settlement factors: water, fertile soil, trade routes, security. Archaeological sites: Nok, Igbo-Ukwu, Daura traditions.


### 1.2: Great Empires: Mali and Songhai (West African Context)

*Duration: 22 minutes*

Mali Empire (13th–15th c.): Mansa Musa, Timbuktu trade/learning, gold-salt trade. Songhai Empire (15th–16th c.): Askia Mohammed, expansion along Niger River, strong cavalry, centralized administration. Influence on trade networks reaching Hausa states; Islam spread via scholars and merchants.


### 1.3: Nigerian Kingdoms and States

*Duration: 25 minutes*

**Kanem-Bornu**: Located in NE; rulers (Mai), trans-Saharan trade (salt, kola, slaves), Islamic scholarship. **Benin Kingdom**: Oba-led, guild system, brass/bronze art, moats, forest trade to coast. **Yoruba states (Oyo, Ife)**: Alaafin (Oyo), Ogboni council; cavalry power; Ife art. **Hausa city-states (Kano, Katsina, Zaria)**: Emir/king, craft production, dye pits, trans-Saharan and trans-Sahel trade.


### 1.4: Social Structures, Culture, and Trade Networks

*Duration: 23 minutes*

Social order: royal families, nobles, guilds, commoners, slaves (varied status). Religion: traditional beliefs, Islam in north, mixed practices. Culture: festivals, art (bronzes, textiles), oral traditions. Trade: trans-Saharan (gold, salt, slaves), coastal trade (pepper, ivory, later palm oil). Market systems and craft specialization supported urban centers.


## Worked Examples


### Example 1.1: Ordering Events on a Timeline

**Context**: Events: (A) Songhai under Askia Mohammed, (B) Nok culture flourishes, (C) Benin moats expanded under Oba Ewuare.

**Problem**: Arrange chronologically.

**Solution**:
```
Nok (c. 1000 BC–300 AD) first; Benin moats/Ewuare (15th c.) second; Songhai Askia (late 15th–early 16th c.) third.
```

**Skills Tested**: Timeline sequencing, Period awareness


### Example 1.2: Linking Trade to Political Power

**Context**: Kanem-Bornu controlled Saharan routes.

**Problem**: How did trade strengthen Kanem-Bornu?

**Solution**:
```
Trade brought revenue and goods, funding armies and administration; control of salt/slave routes increased regional influence and allowed alliances via diplomacy and religion (Islamic scholars).
```

**Skills Tested**: Economic reasoning, Cause-effect in governance


### Example 1.3: Identifying Governance Features

**Context**: Oyo Empire structure.

**Problem**: Name two governance features that balanced the Alaafin's power.

**Solution**:
```
Oyo Mesi council could check the Alaafin; Ogboni council represented earth cult and community; Bashorun could influence succession. These provided checks to prevent tyranny.
```

**Skills Tested**: Political systems, Checks and balances
