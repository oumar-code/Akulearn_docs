## Content


### 2.1: Causes and Process of Colonization

*Duration: 22 minutes*

Motives: economic (raw materials, markets), political rivalry, missionary/religious aims, strategic control. Tools: treaties, protectorates, conquest. Berlin Conference 1884-85 set rules; British consolidated coastal footholds (Lagos 1861) then interior.


### 2.2: Colonial Administration and Indirect Rule

*Duration: 23 minutes*

Indirect rule: using existing traditional rulers under British supervision. Successful in northern emirates with centralized emirate system; mixed results in acephalous societies (Igbo). Administrative hierarchy: Governor, Lieutenant-Governors, Residents, District Officers, Native Authorities. Policies: taxation, land ordinances, railways, cash crop economy (cocoa, groundnuts, palm oil).


### 2.3: Nationalist Movements and Resistance

*Duration: 22 minutes*

Early resistance: Ekumeku (Igbo), Satiru (Sokoto), Aba Women’s War 1929 (tax grievance). Nationalist leaders: Herbert Macaulay (NNDP), Nnamdi Azikiwe (NCNC), Obafemi Awolowo (Action Group), Ahmadu Bello (NPC), Tafawa Balewa. Media (West African Pilot), trade unions, student groups fueled nationalism. Constitutional reforms: Clifford 1922, Richards 1946, Macpherson 1951, Lyttleton 1954 expanded participation.


### 2.4: Road to Independence (1960)

*Duration: 23 minutes*

Regional self-government (1957/1959) → federal elections → negotiation of independence. October 1, 1960: Nigeria independent within Commonwealth; Governor-General Nnamdi Azikiwe; Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa. Post-independence challenges foreshadowed (regional tensions, census disputes).


## Worked Examples


### Example 2.1: Indirect Rule Suitability

**Context**: British applied indirect rule in Northern Nigeria.

**Problem**: Why was it more effective there than in some southern areas?

**Solution**:
```
Northern emirates had centralized authority, tax systems, Islamic courts—structures fit indirect rule. Many southern acephalous societies lacked centralized chiefs, making indirect rule less effective or resisted.
```

**Skills Tested**: Administrative analysis, Comparative governance


### Example 2.2: Linking Economics to Colonial Policy

**Context**: Railways built from ports inland.

**Problem**: What economic purpose did this serve?

**Solution**:
```
Facilitated extraction of cash crops/minerals to ports, integrating Nigeria into British trade network and ensuring cheaper transport for exports/imports.
```

**Skills Tested**: Economic causation, Infrastructure purpose


### Example 2.3: Nationalist Strategy

**Context**: NCNC campaigned for reforms.

**Problem**: Name two strategies nationalists used.

**Solution**:
```
Newspapers and pamphlets to spread ideas; political parties contesting elections; petitions to colonial office; protests/strikes; alliances across regions.
```

**Skills Tested**: Political tactics, Movement analysis
