## Content


### 1.1: Computer Hardware: Core Components

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**Hardware** = physical parts. Key components: 
- **CPU** (processor): ALU (arithmetic/logic), CU (control unit), registers; clock speed (GHz), cores. 
- **Memory**: **RAM** (volatile, working space), **ROM** (non-volatile firmware). 
- **Storage**: HDD/SSD, flash drives; capacity (GB/TB). 
- **Motherboard**: buses, chipset, ports. 
- **Power supply**, cooling (fan/heat sink). 

**Nigerian context**: Labs may use low-power PCs; SSDs improve speed when power is unstable.


### 1.2: Input and Output Devices

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**Input**: keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, scanner, microphone, camera, biometric readers (used in Nigerian exams/banking), barcode/QR readers, sensors (IoT). 
**Output**: monitor (LCD/LED), printer (inkjet/laser), speakers, projector, plotter. 
**I/O**: network cards, USB, storage devices (flash drives popular for file transfer in schools).


### 1.3: Operating Systems

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**OS functions**: manages hardware, provides user interface, file system, process management, memory management, device drivers, security. 
**Types**: single-user vs multi-user, single-task vs multi-task, desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), mobile (Android, iOS), server OS. 
**Interfaces**: GUI vs CLI. 

**Nigerian context**: Many schools use Windows; phones mostly Android; Linux popular for servers/cybercafes due to cost.


### 1.4: Software Types and Categories

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**System software**: OS, device drivers, utilities (antivirus, backup, disk cleanup). 
**Application software**: productivity (word processor, spreadsheet), browsers, media players, educational apps, banking apps (mobile money). 
**Licensing**: proprietary, open-source, freeware, shareware. 

**Nigerian context**: Offline-first apps useful where internet is limited; open-source reduces cost for schools.


## Worked Examples


### Example 1.1: Choosing Storage for a School Lab

**Context**: Lab PCs run slowly with old HDDs.

**Problem**: Recommend upgrade to improve speed.

**Solution**:
```
Replace HDDs with SSDs for faster boot/app load; keep HDD as secondary if large storage needed. SSD benefits under frequent power cycles common in labs with limited power backup.
```

**Skills Tested**: Hardware selection, Performance reasoning


### Example 1.2: Classifying Devices

**Context**: Items: printer, keyboard, projector, scanner, flash drive.

**Problem**: Label each as input/output/storage.

**Solution**:
```
Printer-output; keyboard-input; projector-output; scanner-input; flash drive-storage (also I/O).
```

**Skills Tested**: Device classification


### Example 1.3: OS Role in File Management

**Context**: User saves documents to folders.

**Problem**: Which OS functions are involved?

**Solution**:
```
File system organization, storage allocation, access permissions, UI for browse/save dialog. OS mediates between app and disk using drivers.
```

**Skills Tested**: OS functions, Concept linkage


## Practice Problems


### Basic Level


**1.1.B**: What does CPU stand for?

> **Answer**: Central Processing Unit.

> **Explanation**: Core processor.


**1.2.B**: Is RAM volatile or non-volatile?

> **Answer**: Volatile.

> **Explanation**: Clears when power off.


**1.3.B**: Give one input and one output device.

> **Answer**: Input: keyboard; Output: monitor (examples vary).

> **Explanation**: Device categories.


### Core Level


**1.4.C**: Name two OS functions.

> **Answer**: Process management, memory management, file system, device control, security (any two).

> **Explanation**: Core OS duties.


**1.5.C**: Differentiate system software and application software.

> **Answer**: System runs/manages hardware (OS, drivers); application helps user tasks (Word, browser).

> **Explanation**: Purpose distinction.


**1.6.C**: Why are drivers needed?

> **Answer**: Drivers let OS communicate with specific hardware devices.

> **Explanation**: Hardware abstraction.


### Challenge Level


**1.7.CH**: Suggest two reasons to choose Linux for a school server in Nigeria.

> **Answer**: Lower licensing cost; stability; security; runs on modest hardware; good for networking and web services.

> **Explanation**: Cost/performance rationale.


**1.8.CH**: Compare HDD vs SSD for reliability under frequent power cuts.

> **Answer**: SSDs have no moving parts, better shock tolerance; HDDs risk head crashes; SSD writes can corrupt if power loss mid-write—use surge/UPS; overall SSDs faster and often more resilient.

> **Explanation**: Trade-offs under unstable power.


**1.9.CH**: Name one mobile OS and one desktop OS common in Nigeria.

> **Answer**: Mobile: Android; Desktop: Windows (others: iOS/macOS, Linux).

> **Explanation**: Platform awareness.


**1.10.CH**: Explain why RAM size affects multitasking.

> **Answer**: More RAM allows more programs/data in fast memory, reducing swapping to slower disk; improves multitasking responsiveness.

> **Explanation**: Memory-performance link.
