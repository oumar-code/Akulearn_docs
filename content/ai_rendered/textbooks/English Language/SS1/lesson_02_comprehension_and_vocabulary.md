### 2.1: Reading Strategies and Comprehension Techniques

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**Active Reading Strategies**

**1. PREVIEWING**
- Scan title, headings, first/last paragraphs
- Look at visuals, captions, bold terms
- Predict what text will cover
- Activates prior knowledge

**2. ANNOTATING**
- Underline key points
- Circle unfamiliar words
- Write margin notes
- Mark confusing sections with ?

**3. QUESTIONING**
- Ask who, what, when, where, why, how
- Generate questions before, during, after reading
- Predict answers, then verify

**4. SUMMARIZING**
- Identify main idea of each paragraph
- Condense key points in own words
- Omit minor details
- Check understanding

**5. VISUALIZING**
- Create mental images
- Draw diagrams or charts
- Connect to personal experiences

**Comprehension Levels**

**Literal Comprehension** (surface level):
- What text explicitly states
- Facts, details, sequences
- Who, what, when, where questions
- Example: "Who is the main character?"

**Inferential Comprehension** (reading between lines):
- What text implies but doesn't state directly
- Drawing conclusions from evidence
- Understanding tone, mood, author's purpose
- Example: "Why did the character feel sad?"

**Critical/Evaluative Comprehension** (deeper analysis):
- Judging text quality, accuracy, bias
- Comparing with other texts or experiences
- Forming opinions supported by evidence
- Example: "Is the author's argument convincing?"

**Finding Main Idea and Supporting Details**

**Main Idea**: Central point or message of paragraph/passage
- Often stated in topic sentence (first or last sentence)
- Sometimes implied (reader must infer)

**Supporting Details**: Evidence backing up main idea
- Examples, facts, statistics, descriptions
- Explain, prove, or illustrate main idea

**Strategy**:
1. Read entire paragraph/passage
2. Ask: "What is this mostly about?"
3. Identify topic (who/what)
4. Determine what author says about topic
5. Check if details support that main idea

**Nigerian Context**: When reading Nigerian newspapers (The Guardian, Punch), apply these strategies. Preview headlines and subheadings. Identify main idea (e.g., "Government announces new education policy") and supporting details (statistics, quotes, examples).


### 2.2: Vocabulary Development and Word Families

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Building Vocabulary**

**Word Families**

Word families are groups of related words sharing a common root.

### 2.3: Context Clues and Word Inference

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**Context Clues**

Context clues are hints in surrounding text that help determine meaning of unfamiliar words.

**Types of Context Clues**:

**1. DEFINITION/EXPLANATION**
- Unfamiliar word is defined in sentence
- Signal words: is, means, refers to, is called
- Example: "A carnivore, an animal that eats meat, hunted the prey."
  → carnivore = animal that eats meat

**2. SYNONYM (restatement)**
- Similar word or phrase follows
- Signal words: or, that is, in other words
- Example: "The student was elated, or extremely happy, about the results."
  → elated = extremely happy

**3. ANTONYM (contrast)**
- Opposite meaning provided
- Signal words: but, however, unlike, although
- Example: "Unlike her lethargic brother, she was full of energy."
  → lethargic = lacking energy (opposite of "full of energy")

**4. EXAMPLE**
- Examples illustrate meaning
- Signal words: such as, for example, for instance, like
- Example: "Citrus fruits, such as oranges and lemons, are rich in vitamin C."
  → citrus fruits = fruits like oranges and lemons

**5. INFERENCE/GENERAL CONTEXT**
- Overall meaning of sentence/paragraph suggests word's meaning
- Example: "The arid desert received no rain for months, and the land was parched."
  → arid = dry (no rain, parched land)

**Steps to Use Context Clues**:
1. Read entire sentence carefully
2. Look for signal words
3. Examine surrounding sentences
4. Make an educated guess
5. Check if guess makes sense
6. Verify with dictionary if needed

**Nigerian Context Example**:
"The Lagos traffic was so congested that the driver spent two hours in gridlock, barely moving an inch."
- Context clues: "barely moving," "two hours," "congested"
- Inference: gridlock = severe traffic jam where vehicles can't move


### 2.4: Text Analysis and Literary Devices

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Analyzing Text Structure**

**Common Text Structures**:

1. **Chronological/Sequence**: Events in time order
   - Signal words: first, next, then, finally, before, after

2. **Cause and Effect**: Shows reasons and results
   - Signal words: because, since, as a result, therefore, consequently

3. **Compare and Contrast**: Shows similarities and differences
   - Signal words: similarly, likewise, however, on the other hand, in contrast

4. **Problem and Solution**: Presents issue and resolution
   - Signal words: problem, solution, solved by, one answer is

5. **Description**: Provides details about topic
   - Signal words: for example, such as, characteristics include

**Literary Devices**

**1. SIMILE**
- Comparison using "like" or "as"
- Example: Her smile was as bright as the sun.
- Nigerian example: The Lagos streets were as busy as a market on Saturday.

**2. METAPHOR**
- Direct comparison without "like/as"
- Example: Time is money.
- Nigerian example: The Niger River is the lifeblood of the communities along its banks.

**3. PERSONIFICATION**
- Giving human qualities to non-human things
- Example: The wind whispered through the trees.
- Nigerian example: The harmattan wind danced across the savanna.

**4. HYPERBOLE**
- Exaggeration for effect
- Example: I've told you a million times.
- Nigerian example: The Lagos traffic jam stretched for miles and miles.

**5. ALLITERATION**
- Repetition of initial consonant sounds
- Example: Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
- Nigerian example: Beautiful birds beside the bountiful baobab.

**6. IMAGERY**
- Descriptive language appealing to senses
- Example: The sweet aroma of fresh bread filled the warm kitchen.

**Tone and Mood**

**Tone**: Author's attitude toward subject (formal, informal, serious, humorous, sarcastic)
**Mood**: Feeling created in reader (happy, sad, tense, peaceful)

**Author's Purpose**
- **Persuade**: Convince reader of viewpoint
- **Inform**: Provide facts and information
- **Entertain**: Amuse or engage reader
- **Explain**: Clarify how something works

**Nigerian Context**: In Chinua Achebe's "Things Fall Apart," imagery describes Igbo village life. "The drums were still beating, persistent and unchanging like the heartbeat of the earth" uses simile and personification to convey cultural significance.


## Worked Examples


### Example 2.1: Using Context Clues to Determine Meaning

**Context**: A student reads: "The politician's rhetoric was eloquent and persuasive, moving the audience to applause."

**Problem**: What does 'eloquent' mean based on context clues?

**Solution**:
```
Context clues: 'persuasive,' 'moving the audience to applause.' These suggest positive, effective speaking. Eloquent likely means 'fluent and persuasive in speaking' or 'well-expressed.' The positive outcome (applause) confirms it's a favorable quality.
```

**Skills Tested**: Context clue identification, Word inference, Comprehension


### Example 2.2: Identifying Main Idea and Supporting Details

**Context**: Passage: "Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation with over 200 million people. It has a diverse economy driven by oil, agriculture, and services. Lagos, the commercial capital, is a major financial hub. Despite challenges, Nigeria remains a regional leader."

**Problem**: What is the main idea? List two supporting details.

**Solution**:
```
Main idea: Nigeria is a significant and influential nation in Africa. Supporting details: (1) Over 200 million people (most populous). (2) Diverse economy with oil, agriculture, services. (3) Lagos is financial hub. (4) Regional leader. Any two support the main idea.
```

**Skills Tested**: Main idea identification, Detail extraction, Text analysis


### Example 2.3: Analyzing Literary Devices

**Context**: Sentence from Nigerian literature: "The sun blazed like a furnace over the dry, cracked earth."

**Problem**: Identify the literary device(s) used.

**Solution**:
```
Simile: 'sun blazed like a furnace' compares sun to furnace using 'like.' Imagery: 'dry, cracked earth' appeals to visual sense, creating vivid picture of drought. Both devices emphasize extreme heat.
```

**Skills Tested**: Literary device identification, Figurative language, Text interpretation
