## Content


### 1.1: Parts of Speech

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**The Eight Parts of Speech**

Every word in English belongs to one of eight categories called parts of speech.

**1. NOUNS**
- Definition: Words that name people, places, things, or ideas
- Types: Proper nouns (capitalize), common nouns, abstract nouns, collective nouns
- Examples: Lagos, student, happiness, team

**2. PRONOUNS**
- Definition: Words that replace nouns
- Types: Personal (I, you, he), possessive (my, your), reflexive (myself), relative (who, which)
- Examples: She went to Abuja. The book which I read was interesting.

**3. VERBS**
- Definition: Action or state-of-being words
- Types: Action verbs (run, write), linking verbs (is, seem), auxiliary verbs (have, will)
- Examples: The student studies. Lagos is busy.

**4. ADJECTIVES**
- Definition: Words that describe nouns
- Examples: beautiful, Nigerian, three, many
- Position: Usually before noun or after linking verb

**5. ADVERBS**
- Definition: Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs
- Types: Manner (quickly), time (yesterday), place (here), degree (very)
- Examples: She speaks fluently. He arrived early.

**6. PREPOSITIONS**
- Definition: Words showing relationships between nouns/pronouns and other words
- Common: in, on, at, by, with, from, to, under, between
- Examples: The book is on the table. She traveled from Lagos to Ibadan.

**7. CONJUNCTIONS**
- Definition: Words that connect words, phrases, or clauses
- Coordinating: and, but, or, so, for, yet, nor
- Subordinating: because, although, when, if, since
- Examples: He studied hard, so he passed. Although it rained, we went out.

**8. INTERJECTIONS**
- Definition: Words expressing emotion or exclamation
- Examples: Oh! Wow! Alas! Hey!

**Nigerian Context**: In Nigerian English, parts of speech function the same way. "The Lagos traffic is terrible" uses: The (determiner/adjective), Lagos (proper noun), traffic (noun), is (verb), terrible (adjective).


### 1.2: Sentence Structure and Types

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**What is a Sentence?**

A sentence is a group of words expressing a complete thought. Must have a subject and a predicate.

**Sentence Elements**:
- **Subject**: Who/what the sentence is about
- **Predicate**: What the subject does or is (contains verb)
- **Object**: Receives action of verb (if present)
- **Complement**: Completes meaning after linking verb

**Example**: The student (subject) wrote (predicate/verb) a letter (object).

**Four Types by Purpose**:

1. **Declarative** (statement): Makes a statement, ends with period
   - Example: Nigeria gained independence in 1960.

2. **Interrogative** (question): Asks a question, ends with question mark
   - Example: Where is the University of Lagos?

3. **Imperative** (command): Gives command/request, ends with period or exclamation
   - Example: Close the door. Study hard!

4. **Exclamatory** (exclamation): Shows strong emotion, ends with exclamation mark
   - Example: What a beautiful sunset!

**Four Types by Structure**:

**1. SIMPLE SENTENCE**
- One independent clause (one subject, one verb)
- Structure: Subject + Verb (+ Object/Complement)
- Example: The teacher teaches English.
- Example: Lagos is Nigeria's commercial capital.

**2. COMPOUND SENTENCE**
- Two or more independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunction
- Structure: Independent clause + conjunction + Independent clause
- Example: I studied hard, and I passed the exam.
- Example: She wanted to go to Abuja, but she had no money.

**3. COMPLEX SENTENCE**
- One independent clause + one or more dependent clauses
- Dependent clause begins with subordinating conjunction
- Example: Although it rained, we went to school.
- Example: The student who studied hard passed the exam.

**4. COMPOUND-COMPLEX SENTENCE**
- Two or more independent clauses + one or more dependent clauses
- Example: When the rain stopped, the students went outside, and they played football.

**Nigerian Context**: In formal Nigerian writing (newspapers, official documents), compound and complex sentences show sophistication. "Although Nigeria has oil resources, many citizens still face poverty" is complex.


### 1.3: Verb Tenses and Aspect

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Tense Overview**

Tense shows when an action happens (past, present, future).

**Present Tense**:
- **Simple Present**: Habitual actions, general truths
  - Form: base verb (add -s for 3rd person singular)
  - Examples: I study. She studies. Nigeria has 36 states.

- **Present Continuous**: Actions happening now
  - Form: am/is/are + verb-ing
  - Examples: I am reading. They are traveling to Lagos.

- **Present Perfect**: Actions completed recently or with present relevance
  - Form: have/has + past participle
  - Examples: I have finished. She has visited Abuja three times.

- **Present Perfect Continuous**: Actions started in past, continuing now
  - Form: have/has been + verb-ing
  - Examples: I have been studying for two hours.

**Past Tense**:
- **Simple Past**: Completed actions in past
  - Form: verb + -ed (regular) or irregular form
  - Examples: I walked. She went. Nigeria gained independence in 1960.

- **Past Continuous**: Actions in progress in past
  - Form: was/were + verb-ing
  - Examples: I was reading when you called.

- **Past Perfect**: Actions completed before another past action
  - Form: had + past participle
  - Examples: I had finished before she arrived.

- **Past Perfect Continuous**: Ongoing past action before another past action
  - Form: had been + verb-ing
  - Examples: They had been waiting for an hour when the bus came.

**Future Tense**:
- **Simple Future**: Actions that will happen
  - Form: will/shall + base verb
  - Examples: I will study. Nigeria will host the conference.

- **Future Continuous**: Actions in progress at future time
  - Form: will be + verb-ing
  - Examples: This time tomorrow, I will be traveling.

- **Future Perfect**: Actions completed before future time
  - Form: will have + past participle
  - Examples: By next year, I will have graduated.

**Nigerian Context**: In Nigerian formal English, present perfect is common: "The government has announced new policies." Simple past for specific past events: "The president visited Lagos yesterday."


### 1.4: Subject-Verb Agreement and Concord

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**Subject-Verb Agreement**

Subject and verb must agree in number (singular/plural) and person.

**Basic Rules**:

1. **Singular subject → singular verb**
   - The student is here. (not "are")
   - Lagos has many people. (not "have")

2. **Plural subject → plural verb**
   - The students are here. (not "is")
   - They have arrived. (not "has")

3. **Third person singular (he, she, it) adds -s to present tense verb**
   - He walks. She talks. It works.

**Special Cases**:

**Compound Subjects**:
- Joined by "and" → plural verb
  - Tom and Jerry are friends.
- Joined by "or"/"nor" → verb agrees with nearest subject
  - Either the teacher or the students are responsible.
  - Neither the students nor the teacher is responsible.

**Collective Nouns**:
- Usually singular in British/Nigerian English
  - The team is winning. (team as unit)
  - The government has decided.
- Can be plural if emphasizing individuals
  - The team are arguing among themselves.

**Indefinite Pronouns**:
- Singular: each, every, everyone, everybody, anyone, anybody, someone, somebody, no one, nobody, either, neither
  - Everyone is here. Each student has a book.
- Plural: both, few, many, several
  - Both are correct. Many have arrived.
- Either singular or plural (depends on context): some, all, most, none
  - Some of the water is clean. (water = uncountable)
  - Some of the students are absent. (students = countable)

**Common Errors in Nigerian English**:
- ❌ The government are planning (British influence)
  ✅ The government is planning (standard Nigerian usage)
- ❌ Everyone have finished
  ✅ Everyone has finished
- ❌ The students has arrived
  ✅ The students have arrived

**Nigerian Context**: In formal Nigerian writing (newspapers, official reports), strict subject-verb agreement is expected. "The Nigerian economy is growing" (singular). "Nigerian students are excelling" (plural).


## Worked Examples


### Example 1.1: Identifying Parts of Speech in a Sentence

**Context**: A student analyzes a sentence from a Nigerian newspaper.

**Problem**: Identify the part of speech for each underlined word: "The **dedicated** teacher **quickly** **graded** **all** the **exams** **in** Lagos."

**Solution**:
```
dedicated = adjective (describes teacher); quickly = adverb (modifies graded); graded = verb (action); all = adjective/determiner (describes exams); exams = noun (thing); in = preposition (shows location relationship); Lagos = proper noun (place).
```

**Skills Tested**: Parts of speech identification, Word function in context, Grammatical analysis


### Example 1.2: Constructing Compound and Complex Sentences

**Context**: A student combines simple sentences for an essay.

**Problem**: Combine these simple sentences into (a) compound and (b) complex: "It rained heavily. The match was postponed."

**Solution**:
```
(a) Compound: It rained heavily, so the match was postponed. (Or: It rained heavily, and the match was postponed.)
(b) Complex: Because it rained heavily, the match was postponed. (Or: The match was postponed because it rained heavily.)
```

**Skills Tested**: Sentence combination, Conjunction usage, Sentence structure


### Example 1.3: Correcting Subject-Verb Agreement Errors

**Context**: A student edits sentences for grammatical accuracy.

**Problem**: Correct the errors: (1) "Everyone have submitted their assignments." (2) "The team are playing well." (3) "Either the teachers or the principal are responsible."

**Solution**:
```
(1) Everyone has submitted their assignments. (everyone = singular)
(2) The team is playing well. (collective noun, singular in Nigerian English)
(3) Either the teachers or the principal is responsible. (verb agrees with nearest subject "principal")
```

**Skills Tested**: Subject-verb agreement, Error identification, Concord rules


## Practice Problems


### Basic Level


**1.1.B**: Name the eight parts of speech.

> **Answer**: Noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, interjection.

> **Explanation**: Every word in English belongs to one of these eight categories.


**1.2.B**: What is a simple sentence?

> **Answer**: A sentence with one independent clause (one subject and one verb).

> **Explanation**: Simplest sentence structure expressing a complete thought.


**1.3.B**: Give the past tense of 'write'.

> **Answer**: Wrote.

> **Explanation**: Irregular verb: write, wrote, written.


### Core Level


**1.4.C**: Identify parts of speech: "The **happy** student **quickly** ran **to** school."

> **Answer**: happy = adjective; quickly = adverb; ran = verb; to = preposition.

> **Explanation**: Each word serves a specific grammatical function.


**1.5.C**: Combine using 'although': "It was hot. We went to school."

> **Answer**: Although it was hot, we went to school.

> **Explanation**: Subordinating conjunction creates complex sentence.


**1.6.C**: Correct: "The students has finished their work."

> **Answer**: The students have finished their work.

> **Explanation**: Plural subject requires plural verb.


**1.7.C**: Write present perfect tense of: "I (complete) the assignment."

> **Answer**: I have completed the assignment.

> **Explanation**: Present perfect: have/has + past participle.


### Challenge Level


**1.8.CH**: Explain why this is wrong and correct it: "Neither the teachers nor the students was present."

> **Answer**: Verb should agree with nearest subject (students = plural). Correct: Neither the teachers nor the students were present.

> **Explanation**: With 'neither...nor', verb matches closest subject.


**1.9.CH**: Classify by structure: "When the rain stopped, the students went outside, and they played football."

> **Answer**: Compound-complex (one dependent clause + two independent clauses).

> **Explanation**: Contains subordinate clause and multiple independent clauses.


**1.10.CH**: Rewrite in past perfect continuous: "They wait for two hours before the bus arrived."

> **Answer**: They had been waiting for two hours before the bus arrived.

> **Explanation**: Past perfect continuous shows ongoing action before past event.
