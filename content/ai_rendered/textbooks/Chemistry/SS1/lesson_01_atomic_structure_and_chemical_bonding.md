## Content


### 1.1: Atomic Structure: Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons

*Duration: 18 minutes*

**The Atom**

All matter is made of atoms. An atom is the smallest particle of an element that retains the properties of that element.

**Subatomic Particles**

Atoms are composed of three main subatomic particles:

**1. Protons**
- Location: In the nucleus (center) of the atom
- Charge: Positive (+1)
- Mass: Approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu) or 1.67 × 10⁻²⁷ kg
- Symbol in notation: p⁺ or p

**2. Neutrons**
- Location: In the nucleus
- Charge: Neutral (0)
- Mass: Approximately 1 amu (slightly heavier than proton)
- Symbol: n⁰ or n

**3. Electrons**
- Location: Outside the nucleus in electron shells (orbitals)
- Charge: Negative (-1)
- Mass: Very small (~1/1836 the mass of a proton), negligible in calculations
- Symbol: e⁻

**The Nucleus**

The nucleus contains protons and neutrons. It is extremely dense and contains most of the atom's mass, but occupies only about 1/100,000 of the atom's volume.

**Electron Shells**

Electrons orbit the nucleus in shells or energy levels:
- **First shell (K)**: Can hold maximum 2 electrons
- **Second shell (L)**: Can hold maximum 8 electrons
- **Third shell (M)**: Can hold maximum 18 electrons
- **Fourth shell (N)**: Can hold maximum 32 electrons

**Key Principle**: Atoms are electrically neutral—the number of protons equals the number of electrons.

**Nigerian Context**: In Lagos petrochemical refineries (e.g., NNPC facilities), understanding atomic structure is crucial for analyzing crude oil composition and chemical processes used to produce petrol, diesel, and other products.


### 1.2: Mass Number, Atomic Number, and Isotopes

*Duration: 18 minutes*

**Atomic Number (Z)**

The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus.

**Definition**: Atomic Number = Number of Protons

This number is unique to each element and determines what element the atom is.

**Examples**:
- Hydrogen (H): Atomic number = 1 (1 proton)
- Carbon (C): Atomic number = 6 (6 protons)
- Oxygen (O): Atomic number = 8 (8 protons)
- Iron (Fe): Atomic number = 26 (26 protons)

**Mass Number (A)**

The mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

**Definition**: Mass Number = Protons + Neutrons
**A = Z + N**

where:
- A = mass number
- Z = atomic number (protons)
- N = number of neutrons

**Notation**:

Isotopes are written as: **ᴬ_Z X** or **X-A**

where X is the element symbol.

**Examples**:
- ¹⁶₈O: Oxygen-16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons)
- ¹⁸₈O: Oxygen-18 (8 protons, 10 neutrons)
- ¹²₆C: Carbon-12 (6 protons, 6 neutrons)
- ¹⁴₆C: Carbon-14 (6 protons, 8 neutrons)

**Isotopes**

Isotopes are atoms of the same element (same atomic number) but with different numbers of neutrons (different mass numbers).

**Properties of Isotopes**:
- Same element (same number of protons)
- Different mass numbers (different numbers of neutrons)
- Chemical properties are very similar
- Physical properties differ (density, melting point, radioactivity)

**Examples**:
- Hydrogen-1, Deuterium (Hydrogen-2), Tritium (Hydrogen-3)
- Carbon-12 (stable), Carbon-14 (radioactive, used in dating)

**Relative Atomic Mass**

The relative atomic mass is the weighted average mass of all isotopes of an element.

**Relative Atomic Mass = Σ(mass × abundance) / 100**

**Nigerian Context**: Nigeria's oil industry deals with hydrocarbons containing carbon isotopes. Understanding mass number helps in analyzing crude oil composition and predicting chemical behavior during refining processes at facilities like the Dangote Refinery in Lagos.


### 1.3: Electron Configuration and Valency

*Duration: 20 minutes*

**Electron Configuration**

Electron configuration describes how electrons are distributed among the shells of an atom.

**Rules for Electron Configuration**:

1. **Aufbau Principle**: Electrons fill orbitals starting from the lowest energy level
2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: Maximum 2 electrons per orbital
3. **Hund's Rule**: Electrons occupy orbitals singly before pairing

**Shell Capacity**:
- **First shell (K)**: 2 electrons maximum (1s²)
- **Second shell (L)**: 8 electrons maximum (2s² 2p⁶)
- **Third shell (M)**: 18 electrons maximum (3s² 3p⁶ 3d¹⁰)

**Writing Electron Configurations**

**Method 1: Shell Notation (Simplified)**

Write the number of electrons in each shell:

**Examples**:
- Hydrogen (H, Z=1): 1
- Carbon (C, Z=6): 2,4
- Oxygen (O, Z=8): 2,6
- Sodium (Na, Z=11): 2,8,1
- Chlorine (Cl, Z=17): 2,8,7
- Argon (Ar, Z=18): 2,8,8

**Method 2: Orbital Notation (Full)**

Write the subshell designation and electron count:

**Examples**:
- Hydrogen (H): 1s¹
- Carbon (C): 1s² 2s² 2p²
- Oxygen (O): 1s² 2s² 2p⁴
- Sodium (Na): 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s¹

**Valency**

Valency is the combining capacity of an element. It represents the number of electrons an atom can lose, gain, or share to achieve a stable electron configuration.

**Valency and Electron Configuration**:

- **Atoms with full outer shells** (noble gases like Ne, Ar): Valency = 0 (inert)
- **Atoms with 1 electron in outer shell**: Valency = 1 (lose 1 or share 1)
- **Atoms with 2 electrons in outer shell**: Valency = 2 (lose 2 or share 2)
- **Atoms with 3 electrons in outer shell**: Valency = 3 (lose 3 or share 3)
- **Atoms with 4 electrons in outer shell**: Valency = 4 (share 4)
- **Atoms with 5 electrons in outer shell**: Valency = 3 (share or gain 3)
- **Atoms with 6 electrons in outer shell**: Valency = 2 (share or gain 2)
- **Atoms with 7 electrons in outer shell**: Valency = 1 (gain 1 or share 1)

**Examples**:
- Sodium (Na): 2,8,1 → Valency = 1 (loses 1)
- Chlorine (Cl): 2,8,7 → Valency = 1 (gains 1)
- Oxygen (O): 2,6 → Valency = 2 (gains 2)
- Carbon (C): 2,4 → Valency = 4 (shares 4)

**Octet Rule**

The octet rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a stable configuration with 8 electrons in the outer shell (or 2 for hydrogen).

**Nigerian Context**: In the Dangote Fertilizer plant in Lagos, understanding valency is essential for predicting how nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium atoms will combine to form fertilizer compounds.


### 1.4: Types of Chemical Bonding

*Duration: 24 minutes*

**Chemical Bonds**

A chemical bond is the force that holds atoms together in molecules and compounds. Atoms bond to achieve stable electron configurations (usually 8 electrons in the outer shell, following the octet rule).

**Three Main Types of Bonding**

---

**1. IONIC BONDING**

**Definition**: Ionic bonding occurs when electrons are transferred from one atom to another, creating oppositely charged ions that attract.

**Characteristics**:
- Complete electron transfer
- Forms between metals and nonmetals
- Creates cations (positive ions) and anions (negative ions)
- Strong electrostatic attraction
- Occurs in solid state

**Mechanism**:
1. Metal atom loses electron(s) → becomes cation (positive)
2. Nonmetal atom gains electron(s) → becomes anion (negative)
3. Electrostatic attraction between ions holds compound together

**Examples**:
- **NaCl (Sodium Chloride)**:
  - Na (2,8,1) loses 1 electron → Na⁺ (2,8)
  - Cl (2,8,7) gains 1 electron → Cl⁻ (2,8,8)
  - Attraction: Na⁺ ← → Cl⁻

- **MgO (Magnesium Oxide)**:
  - Mg (2,8,2) loses 2 electrons → Mg²⁺
  - O (2,6) gains 2 electrons → O²⁻

**Properties of Ionic Compounds**:
- Solids at room temperature
- High melting and boiling points
- Conduct electricity when molten or dissolved
- Often soluble in polar solvents (water)
- Brittle (shatter when hit)

**Nigerian Context**: Table salt (NaCl) from Lagos coastal areas and evaporation ponds is a common ionic compound. Rock salt mining in Edo State produces halite (NaCl).

---

**2. COVALENT BONDING**

**Definition**: Covalent bonding occurs when atoms share pairs of electrons to achieve stable configurations.

**Characteristics**:
- Electron sharing (not transfer)
- Forms between nonmetals
- Creates molecules
- Varies in strength (single, double, triple bonds)
- Can be polar or nonpolar

**Types of Covalent Bonds**:

**Single Bond** (1 shared pair of electrons)
- Example: H-H (hydrogen), C-H
- Denoted by single line: —

**Double Bond** (2 shared pairs)
- Example: O=O (oxygen), C=O
- Denoted by double line: =

**Triple Bond** (3 shared pairs)
- Example: N≡N (nitrogen), C≡C
- Denoted by triple line: ≡

**Examples**:
- **H₂ (Hydrogen gas)**:
  - Each H atom has 1 electron
  - They share 1 pair: H:H or H-H
  - Both achieve the stable 2-electron configuration

- **H₂O (Water)**:
  - O needs 2 electrons (has 6, needs 8)
  - Each H needs 1 electron (has 1, needs 2)
  - O forms 2 single bonds with H atoms
  - Molecular formula: H-O-H

- **CO₂ (Carbon dioxide)**:
  - C needs 4 electrons (has 4, needs 8)
  - O needs 2 electrons each (has 6, needs 8)
  - C forms double bonds with each O: O=C=O

**Polar vs Nonpolar Covalent**:
- **Nonpolar**: Electrons shared equally (e.g., Cl-Cl, H-H)
- **Polar**: Electrons shared unequally (e.g., H-O, C-O)

**Properties of Covalent Compounds**:
- Low melting and boiling points
- Poor electrical conductivity
- Often soluble in nonpolar solvents (oils, fats)
- Many are gases or liquids
- Softer than ionic compounds

**Nigerian Context**: Petroleum compounds (hydrocarbons) are covalent compounds. Petrol (C₈H₁₈), diesel (C₁₆H₃₄), and other fuel products from Nigerian oil refineries contain covalent bonds.

---

**3. METALLIC BONDING**

**Definition**: Metallic bonding occurs when metal atoms lose valence electrons, which move freely in a "sea" around the cations.

**Characteristics**:
- Electrons delocalized (mobile)
- Forms between metal atoms
- Creates "sea" of electrons
- Strong but flexible bonding

**Mechanism**:
- Metal atoms lose valence electrons
- Electrons form a mobile "electron sea"
- Metal cations held in place by attraction to electron sea

**Examples**:
- **Iron (Fe)**: Fe atoms lose valence electrons; electrons form sea
- **Copper (Cu)**: Cu atoms form electron sea; high electrical conductivity

**Properties of Metals**:
- High melting and boiling points
- Excellent electrical and thermal conductivity
- Malleability (can be hammered into sheets)
- Ductility (can be drawn into wires)
- Lustrous (shiny)
- Solids at room temperature (except Hg)

**Nigerian Context**: Iron ore mining in Nigeria (Kogi, Enugu) produces Fe₂O₃ which is reduced to pure iron. Steel production uses metallic bonding principles. Aluminum production also relies on metallic bonding concepts.

**Comparison Table**

| Property | Ionic | Covalent | Metallic |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| Electron behavior | Transfer | Share | Delocalized |
| Types of atoms | Metal + Nonmetal | Nonmetals | Metals |
| State | Usually solid | Varied | Solid (mostly) |
| Melting point | High | Low-High | High |
| Electrical conductivity | Only when molten/dissolved | Poor | Excellent |
| Solubility | Often water-soluble | Varied | Insoluble in water |
| Example | NaCl, CaCO₃ | H₂O, CO₂, O₂ | Fe, Cu, Al |


### 1.5: Periodic Table Organization

*Duration: 10 minutes*

**Organization of the Periodic Table**

The periodic table arranges elements by atomic number and electron configuration.

**Rows (Periods)**

Each row represents one shell of electrons:
- **Period 1**: Elements with 1 shell (H, He)
- **Period 2**: Elements with 2 shells (Li through Ne)
- **Period 3**: Elements with 3 shells (Na through Ar)

As you move down the periodic table, elements have more electron shells.

**Columns (Groups)**

Elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons and similar chemical properties:
- **Group 1** (Alkali metals): 1 valence electron
- **Group 2** (Alkaline earth metals): 2 valence electrons
- **Group 13-17**: 3-7 valence electrons
- **Group 18** (Noble gases): 8 valence electrons (full outer shell, inert)

**Blocks**
- **s-block**: Groups 1-2
- **p-block**: Groups 13-18
- **d-block**: Transition metals
- **f-block**: Lanthanides and actinides

**Trend: Valency and Group Number**

For main group elements (s and p blocks):
- Valency = Group number (for Groups 1-4)
- Valency = 8 - Group number (for Groups 5-7)
- Valency = 0 (Group 18, noble gases)

**Nigerian Context**: The periodic table helps Nigerian chemists and engineers identify elements found in mineral deposits. Nigeria has reserves of elements like tin (Sn), tantalum (Ta), columbite, and iron (Fe) that are positioned in specific groups based on their properties.

(d) Electron configuration (shell notation):
- First shell (K): 2 electrons (full)
- Second shell (L): 8 electrons (full)
- Third shell (M): 8 electrons (full)
- Fourth shell (N): 2 electrons

Electron configuration: 2,8,8,2

Or in orbital notation: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s²
```

**Skills Tested**: Mass number concept, Atomic number application, Electron configuration, Subatomic particle identification


### Example 1.2: Identifying Ionic Bonding and Electron Transfer

**Problem**: Show how MgCl₂ forms through ionic bonding. Include electron configurations before and after bonding.

**Solution**:
```
Magnesium (Mg, Z=12) and Chlorine (Cl, Z=17)

Initial electron configurations:
- Mg: 2,8,2 (12 electrons)
- Cl: 2,8,7 (17 electrons)

Electron transfer:
1. Mg atom loses 2 electrons (valency = 2)
   Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻
   Becomes: 2,8 configuration (10 electrons)

2. Each Cl atom gains 1 electron (valency = 1)
   Cl + e⁻ → Cl⁻
   Becomes: 2,8,8 configuration (18 electrons)

Formula: MgCl₂ (one Mg²⁺ and two Cl⁻ ions)

Structure: Mg²⁺ [Cl⁻, Cl⁻] with electrostatic attractions

All ions achieve noble gas configuration (full outer shells).
```

**Skills Tested**: Electron transfer, Ionic bonding mechanism, Ion formation, Valency application


### Example 1.3: Analyzing Covalent Bonding in Water

**Context**: A student analyzes the molecular structure of water (H₂O), essential in Nigerian water purification and industrial processes.

**Problem**: Explain how oxygen and hydrogen atoms bond in water. Show electron configurations and identify the type of covalent bonding.

**Solution**:
```
Oxygen (O, Z=8) and Hydrogen (H, Z=1)

Initial electron configurations:
- O: 2,6 (needs 2 more electrons for stability)
- H: 1 (needs 1 more electron for stability)

Bonding mechanism:
1. Oxygen needs 2 electrons; forms 2 single bonds
2. Each hydrogen needs 1 electron; shares with oxygen
3. Covalent bonding: O-H and O-H (two single bonds)
4. Molecular formula: H-O-H or H₂O

Electron sharing:
- O shares 1 pair with 1st H
- O shares 1 pair with 2nd H
- Both H atoms achieve 2-electron configuration (H₂ equivalent)
- O achieves 8-electron configuration

Type: Polar covalent (because O pulls electrons more strongly than H)

Result: Water molecule is stable, abundant in Nigerian waterways.
```

**Skills Tested**: Covalent bonding concept, Electron sharing, Octet rule, Molecular structure determination
