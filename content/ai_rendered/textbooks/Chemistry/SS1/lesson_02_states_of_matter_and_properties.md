### 2.1: Solids, Liquids, and Gases: Structure and Properties

*Duration: 18 minutes*

**Three States of Matter**

Matter exists in three common states based on how particles (atoms/molecules) are arranged and how they move:

---

**1. SOLIDS**

**Particle Arrangement**:
- Particles are tightly packed in fixed, regular patterns (crystal lattices)
- Particles held in place by strong intermolecular forces
- Minimal space between particles

**Particle Motion**:
- Particles vibrate in fixed positions
- Cannot move freely from place to place

**Characteristics**:
- **Fixed shape**: Solid maintains its shape regardless of container
- **Fixed volume**: Solid has definite volume (cannot be compressed easily)
- **Incompressible**: Very difficult to compress because particles are already tightly packed
- **Dense**: Higher density than liquids and gases

**Examples**: Iron (Fe), salt (NaCl), diamond, ice

**Nigerian Context**: Building materials like concrete and steel used in Lagos construction are solids with fixed structure.

---

**2. LIQUIDS**

**Particle Arrangement**:
- Particles are close together but not in fixed pattern
- Some intermolecular forces exist, but weaker than in solids
- Particles in random arrangement

**Particle Motion**:
- Particles can move and slide past each other
- Have kinetic energy to move around
- Can flow from place to place

**Characteristics**:
- **No fixed shape**: Liquid takes shape of container it occupies
- **Fixed volume**: Liquid has definite volume
- **Nearly incompressible**: Slight compression possible (but much less than gases)
- **Moderate density**: Between solids and gases
- **Flows**: Liquid can be poured and flows under gravity

**Examples**: Water (H₂O), oil, mercury, petrol

**Nigerian Context**: Nigeria's crude oil and refined petroleum products (petrol, diesel) are liquids transported through pipelines and refineries.

---

**3. GASES**

**Particle Arrangement**:
- Particles are far apart with large spaces between them
- Negligible intermolecular forces
- Random, dispersed distribution

**Particle Motion**:
- Particles move at high speeds in all directions
- Constant, random motion
- Collide with container walls (causing pressure)

**Characteristics**:
- **No fixed shape**: Gas fills entire container and takes its shape
- **No fixed volume**: Gas expands to fill any container volume
- **Highly compressible**: Can be compressed significantly
- **Low density**: Much less dense than solids and liquids
- **Exerts pressure**: Gas pressure results from particle collisions with walls

**Examples**: Air (N₂, O₂), hydrogen (H₂), natural gas, oxygen

**Nigerian Context**: Nigeria's natural gas reserves in the Niger Delta are processed at facilities like Bonny LNG, where natural gas is liquefied for export.

**Comparison Table**

| Property | Solid | Liquid | Gas |
|----------|-------|--------|-----|
| Particle spacing | Close together | Close together | Far apart |
| Shape | Fixed | Takes container shape | Fills container |
| Volume | Fixed | Fixed | No fixed volume |
| Compressibility | Incompressible | Nearly incompressible | Highly compressible |
| Density | High | Moderate | Low |
| Particle motion | Vibration only | Free movement | Random, fast |
| Example | Iron, ice | Water, oil | Air, oxygen |


### 2.2: Kinetic Theory of Matter

*Duration: 18 minutes*

**What is Kinetic Theory?**

Kinetic theory is a model that explains the properties of matter by describing the motion of particles (atoms and molecules) and the forces between them.

**Basic Assumptions of Kinetic Theory**:

1. **Matter is composed of particles** (atoms or molecules)
2. **Particles are in constant random motion**
3. **The average kinetic energy of particles is proportional to absolute temperature** (E_k ∝ T)
4. **Particles experience elastic collisions** (no energy loss)
5. **Intermolecular forces vary** (strong in solids, moderate in liquids, negligible in gases)

**Explaining States Using Kinetic Theory**

---

**In SOLIDS**:
- Particles vibrate in fixed positions
- Kinetic energy is LOW (only vibration)
- Intermolecular forces are STRONG (hold particles in place)
- Regular arrangement (crystal structure)
- Result: Fixed shape and volume

---

**In LIQUIDS**:
- Particles move with moderate kinetic energy
- Kinetic energy is MODERATE
- Intermolecular forces are MODERATE (weaker than solids)
- Particles can slide past each other
- Result: No fixed shape, but fixed volume

---

**In GASES**:
- Particles move rapidly and randomly
- Kinetic energy is HIGH
- Intermolecular forces are NEGLIGIBLE (very weak)
- Particles move independently
- Result: No fixed shape or volume; fills container

**Pressure in Gases (Kinetic Theory)**

Gas pressure arises from particle collisions with container walls.

**Pressure = Force / Area**

When:
- Temperature increases → particle speed increases → more collisions → pressure increases
- Volume decreases → particles closer together → more frequent collisions → pressure increases
- Number of particles increases → more collisions → pressure increases

**Relationship**: **PV = NkT** (or **PV = nRT** in ideal gas law)

where:
- P = pressure
- V = volume
- N (or n) = number of particles (or moles)
- k (or R) = Boltzmann/gas constant
- T = absolute temperature (Kelvin)

**Temperature and Kinetic Energy**

**Kinetic Energy (average) = (3/2)kT**

Implications:
- Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy
- Absolute zero (0 K) = no particle motion (theoretical)
- Higher temperature = faster particles = more vigorous motion

**Nigerian Context**: In Lagos water treatment plants, understanding kinetic theory helps explain why heating increases evaporation rate and why gases dissolve better in cooler water.


### 2.3: Phase Changes

*Duration: 25 minutes*

**Phase Changes** (or state changes) occur when matter converts from one state to another.

All phase changes involve energy transfer:
- **Endothermic**: Heat absorbed (melting, boiling, sublimation)
- **Exothermic**: Heat released (condensation, freezing, deposition)

---

**1. MELTING (Solid → Liquid)**

**Definition**: Melting is the phase change from solid to liquid when heat is absorbed.

**What happens**:
- Heat provides energy to particles
- Particles vibrate more vigorously
- Intermolecular bonds break
- Particles gain freedom to move (but stay close)
- Result: Liquid state

**Melting Point**: Temperature at which solid becomes liquid

**Examples**:
- Ice melts at 0°C (273 K)
- Iron melts at 1538°C
- Table salt melts at 801°C

**Endothermic process**: Heat is absorbed
- Q = m × L_f (latent heat of fusion)

---

**2. FREEZING (Liquid → Solid)**

**Definition**: Freezing is the phase change from liquid to solid when heat is removed.

**What happens**:
- Heat is removed
- Particle motion decreases
- Intermolecular forces become dominant
- Particles settle into fixed crystal structure
- Result: Solid state

**Freezing Point**: Temperature at which liquid becomes solid

**Examples**:
- Water freezes at 0°C (273 K)
- Oil freezes at lower temperature (more flexible)

**Exothermic process**: Heat is released

---

**3. BOILING (Liquid → Gas)**

**Definition**: Boiling is the phase change from liquid to gas when enough heat is absorbed to break all intermolecular bonds.

**What happens**:
- Heat absorbed provides energy
- Particles move very fast
- Intermolecular forces overcome completely
- Particles escape to gaseous state
- Result: Gas state

**Boiling Point**: Temperature at which liquid becomes gas

**Examples**:
- Water boils at 100°C (373 K) at 1 atm pressure
- Petrol boils at ~70°C (volatile)
- Different at different atmospheric pressures

**Endothermic process**: Heat absorbed
- Q = m × L_v (latent heat of vaporization)
- L_v >> L_f (much more energy needed for boiling than melting)

---

**4. CONDENSATION (Gas → Liquid)**

**Definition**: Condensation is the phase change from gas to liquid when heat is removed.

**What happens**:
- Heat is removed
- Particle speed decreases
- Intermolecular forces recapture particles
- Particles come together into liquid state
- Result: Liquid state

**Condensation Temperature**: Same as boiling point (reverse process)

**Examples**:
- Water vapor condenses to liquid water at 100°C (at 1 atm)
- Dew formation on cold surfaces

**Exothermic process**: Heat is released

---

**5. SUBLIMATION (Solid → Gas)**

**Definition**: Sublimation is direct phase change from solid to gas without passing through liquid state.

**What happens**:
- Heat absorbed provides energy
- Particles break free directly from solid arrangement
- Particles become gaseous without intermediate liquid state
- Result: Gas state

**Examples**:
- Dry ice (solid CO₂) sublimes at -78°C
- Iodine crystals sublime to purple vapor
- Mothballs (naphthalene) sublime in air

**Endothermic process**: Heat absorbed

---

**6. DEPOSITION (Gas → Solid)**

**Definition**: Deposition is direct phase change from gas to solid without passing through liquid state.

**What happens**:
- Heat is removed
- Gas particles lose energy rapidly
- Particles settle directly into solid crystal structure
- Result: Solid state

**Examples**:
- Frost formation on cold grass (water vapor → ice)
- Iodine vapor → iodine crystals

**Exothermic process**: Heat is released

---

**Phase Diagram**

A phase diagram shows which state is stable at given pressure and temperature.

**Key Features**:
- **Triple point**: Temperature/pressure where all three states coexist
- **Critical point**: Temperature/pressure above which liquid and gas cannot be distinguished
- **Solid region**: Low temperature, high pressure
- **Liquid region**: Intermediate temperature and pressure
- **Gas region**: High temperature, low pressure

**Nigerian Context**: In NNPC refineries in Port Harcourt, understanding phase changes is crucial. Crude oil components have different boiling points, allowing separation through fractional distillation: heavy fractions (fuel oil) boil at high temps, light fractions (petrol) at low temps.


### 2.4: Gas Laws and Pressure-Volume-Temperature Relationships

*Duration: 18 minutes*

**Gas Behavior and Laws**

Gases behave predictably according to mathematical relationships between pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T), and amount of gas (n).

---

**1. BOYLE'S LAW (Pressure-Volume Relationship)**

**Statement**: At constant temperature, pressure is inversely proportional to volume.

**Formula**: **P₁V₁ = P₂V₂** (at constant T)

or: **PV = constant**

**Interpretation**:
- If volume decreases → pressure increases
- If volume increases → pressure decreases

**Example**: A syringe with gas
- Push plunger in (decrease volume) → pressure increases
- Pull plunger out (increase volume) → pressure decreases

**Nigerian Context**: In compressed gas cylinders at hospitals and welding shops, reducing volume increases pressure inside the cylinder.

---

**2. CHARLES'S LAW (Volume-Temperature Relationship)**

**Statement**: At constant pressure, volume is directly proportional to absolute temperature.

**Formula**: **V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂** (at constant P)

or: **V ∝ T** (absolute temperature in Kelvin)

**Interpretation**:
- If temperature increases → volume increases
- If temperature decreases → volume decreases

**Example**: Inflating a balloon
- Heat balloon (increase T) → volume expands
- Cool balloon (decrease T) → volume contracts

**Important**: Must use absolute temperature (Kelvin), not Celsius
- T(K) = T(°C) + 273

**Nigerian Context**: Hot air balloons rise because heated air expands (increases volume/decreases density) allowing lift.

---

**3. GAY-LUSSAC'S LAW (Pressure-Temperature Relationship)**

**Statement**: At constant volume, pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature.

**Formula**: **P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂** (at constant V)

or: **P ∝ T** (absolute temperature)

**Interpretation**:
- If temperature increases → pressure increases
- If temperature decreases → pressure decreases

**Example**: Sealed container with gas
- Heat container (increase T) → pressure increases
- Cool container (decrease T) → pressure decreases

**Nigerian Context**: Tires in parked vehicles in hot Lagos expand as temperature rises due to pressure increase inside the tire.

---

**4. IDEAL GAS LAW**

**Combines all three relationships**:

**PV = nRT**

where:
- P = pressure (Pa or atm)
- V = volume (m³ or L)
- n = number of moles
- R = gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K) or 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K))
- T = absolute temperature (Kelvin)

**Using the Ideal Gas Law**:

Example: Calculate pressure of 2 moles of gas at 300 K in 10 L container
- PV = nRT
- P(10) = 2(8.314)(300) / 1000 (converting to L·atm)
- P = 4.988 atm ≈ 5 atm

**Assumptions of Ideal Gas**:
- Particles have negligible volume
- Intermolecular forces negligible
- Collisions are elastic
- Average kinetic energy ∝ temperature

**Real vs Ideal Gases**:
- Real gases deviate at high pressures and low temperatures
- Most gases behave ideally at room conditions

**Nigerian Context**: Natural gas from Niger Delta facilities must be compressed for storage and transport. Gas laws predict how compression affects pressure and volume.


## Worked Examples


### Example 2.1: Applying Boyle's Law to Gas Compression

**Context**: A compressor in a Nigerian workshop compresses air from atmospheric conditions. Initial volume is 5 L at 1 atm pressure.

**Problem**: If the air is compressed to 1 L, what is the final pressure? (Temperature remains constant)

**Solution**:
```
Given:
- Initial pressure (P₁) = 1 atm
- Initial volume (V₁) = 5 L
- Final volume (V₂) = 1 L
- Temperature constant

Using Boyle's Law: P₁V₁ = P₂V₂

1 × 5 = P₂ × 1
P₂ = 5 atm

Interpretation: Compressing air to 1/5 its original volume increases pressure 5 times. This is why compressed air cylinders have high pressure.
```

**Skills Tested**: Boyle's Law application, Gas pressure calculation, Inverse proportionality


### Example 2.2: Applying Charles's Law to Balloon Volume

**Context**: A weather balloon contains helium gas. At ground level (27°C), volume is 2 m³.

**Problem**: As the balloon rises to altitude where temperature is -23°C, what is the new volume? (Pressure remains approximately constant)

**Solution**:
```
Given:
- Initial temperature (T₁) = 27°C = 27 + 273 = 300 K
- Final temperature (T₂) = -23°C = -23 + 273 = 250 K
- Initial volume (V₁) = 2 m³
- Pressure constant

Using Charles's Law: V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂

2/300 = V₂/250
V₂ = (2 × 250)/300
V₂ = 1.67 m³

Interpretation: Lower temperature causes volume to decrease. The balloon shrinks as it rises because temperature drops. Must use Kelvin temperatures!
```

**Skills Tested**: Charles's Law application, Temperature conversion, Direct proportionality, Kelvin scale


### Example 2.3: Using Ideal Gas Law to Calculate Gas Pressure

**Context**: A natural gas storage facility in Lagos stores 1000 moles of methane (CH₄) at 25°C in a 100 m³ tank.

**Problem**: Calculate the pressure of the gas in the tank (R = 8.314 J/(mol·K))

**Solution**:
```
Given:
- n = 1000 moles
- T = 25°C = 25 + 273 = 298 K
- V = 100 m³
- R = 8.314 J/(mol·K)

Using Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT

P = nRT/V
P = (1000 × 8.314 × 298) / 100
P = 2,477,572 / 100
P = 24,775.72 Pa ≈ 24.8 kPa

Or in atmospheres: P ≈ 0.24 atm

Interpretation: Large amount of gas in large volume results in moderate pressure. Storage facilities must be designed to withstand these pressures.
```

**Skills Tested**: Ideal Gas Law application, Pressure calculation, Unit conversion, Molar concepts
