## Content


### 3.1: Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations

*Duration: 20 minutes*

**Chemical Equations**

A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction showing reactants, products, and stoichiometric coefficients.

**General Form**: **Reactants → Products**

or: **Reactants → Products (conditions)**

Example: **2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O**
- Reactants: H₂ and O₂
- Product: H₂O
- Coefficients: 2, 1, 2

**Parts of Equation**:
- **Formulas**: Represent substances (H₂O, CO₂, NaCl)
- **Coefficients**: Numbers before formulas (balance atoms)
- **Arrow**: Shows direction (→ or ⇌ for reversible)
- **Conditions**: Temperature, pressure, catalyst (written above arrow)

**Law of Conservation of Mass**

In any chemical reaction, mass is neither created nor destroyed. The number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides.

**Balancing Equations**

A balanced equation has equal numbers of each type of atom on both sides.

**Method**:
1. Count atoms of each element on both sides
2. Identify atoms not balanced
3. Add coefficients (never change subscripts)
4. Recount to verify balance

**Example 1: Combustion of Methane**
Unbalanced: CH₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O

Atom count (unbalanced):
- C: 1 left, 1 right ✓
- H: 4 left, 2 right ✗
- O: 2 left, 4 right ✗

Add coefficient 2 to H₂O: CH₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O
Recount: H: 4 left, 4 right ✓; O: 2 left, 4 right ✗

Add coefficient 2 to O₂: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O
Final count: All balanced ✓

**Balanced**: **CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O**

**Symbol Meanings**:
- → : Single arrow (irreversible reaction)
- ⇌ : Double arrow (reversible reaction)
- ↑ : Gas escapes
- ↓ : Precipitate forms
- (s) : Solid state
- (l) : Liquid state
- (g) : Gaseous state
- (aq) : Aqueous (dissolved in water)

**Example 2: Ionic Equation**
**AgNO₃(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)**

**Nigerian Context**: In Lagos water treatment, reactions are written to show precipitation of impurities:
**Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 3Ca(OH)₂ → 2Fe(OH)₃↓ + 3CaSO₄**


### 3.2: Types of Chemical Reactions

*Duration: 20 minutes*

**Four Main Types of Chemical Reactions**

---

**1. SYNTHESIS (Combination) Reactions**

**Pattern**: **A + B → AB** (Two or more substances combine)

**Characteristics**:
- Two or more reactants
- One product
- Forming more complex substance

**Examples**:
- **2Na + Cl₂ → 2NaCl** (Metal + nonmetal → salt)
- **2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O** (Hydrogen + oxygen → water)
- **C + O₂ → CO₂** (Carbon + oxygen → carbon dioxide)

**Nigerian Context**: Iron ore (Fe₂O₃) reduction in furnaces:
**4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃** (reverse of smelting)

---

**2. DECOMPOSITION Reactions**

**Pattern**: **AB → A + B** (One substance breaks into two or more)

**Characteristics**:
- One reactant
- Two or more products
- Usually requires heat, light, or electricity

**Examples**:
- **2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂** (Electrolysis of water)
- **2HgO → 2Hg + O₂** (Thermal decomposition)
- **CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂** (Limestone decomposition)

**Nigerian Context**: Limestone (CaCO₃) used in cement production:
**CaCO₃ (heat)→ CaO + CO₂** (Calcination)

---

**3. DISPLACEMENT Reactions**

**Pattern**: **AB + C → AC + B** (More reactive element displaces less reactive)

**Characteristics**:
- One element replaces another in compound
- Single displacement: A + BC → AC + B
- Double displacement: AB + CD → AD + CB

**Examples (Single Displacement)**:
- **Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu** (Zn more reactive than Cu)
- **2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂↑** (Na very reactive)
- **Fe + CuSO₄ → FeSO₄ + Cu** (Fe more reactive than Cu)

**Examples (Double Displacement)**:
- **AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl↓ + NaNO₃** (Precipitation)
- **HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O** (Acid-base neutralization)
- **BaCl₂ + Na₂SO₄ → BaSO₄↓ + NaCl** (Precipitation)

**Nigerian Context**: In water treatment, precipitation removes hardness:
**CaCl₂ + Na₂CO₃ → CaCO₃↓ + NaCl**

---

**4. COMBUSTION Reactions**

**Pattern**: **Fuel + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + energy**

**Characteristics**:
- Substance reacts with oxygen
- Produces heat (exothermic)
- Complete combustion produces CO₂ and H₂O
- Incomplete combustion produces CO and C (soot)

**Examples**:
- **CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O** (Complete combustion of methane)
- **2C₈H₁₈ + 25O₂ → 16CO₂ + 18H₂O** (Petrol combustion)
- **2C + O₂ → 2CO** (Incomplete combustion)

**Nigerian Context**: Combustion of Nigerian crude oil components at refineries produces energy and CO₂:
**C₁₆H₃₄ + 24.5O₂ → 16CO₂ + 17H₂O** (Diesel combustion)


### 3.3: Stoichiometry and Molar Calculations

*Duration: 25 minutes*

**Stoichiometry**

Stoichiometry is the study of quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions.

**Molar Relationships**

Coefficients in balanced equations represent molar ratios.

**Example**: **CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O**

Molar ratio: 1 mol CH₄ : 2 mol O₂ : 1 mol CO₂ : 2 mol H₂O

Interpretation:
- 1 mole of CH₄ reacts with 2 moles of O₂
- Produces 1 mole of CO₂ and 2 moles of H₂O
- 6.022 × 10²³ molecules of CH₄ react with 2 × 6.022 × 10²³ molecules of O₂

**Molar Mass**

Molar mass (M) = mass of 1 mole of substance (g/mol)

Calculated by summing atomic masses of all atoms in formula.

**Example**: H₂O
- H: 1.008 × 2 = 2.016
- O: 16.00
- Total: 18.016 g/mol ≈ 18 g/mol

**Converting Between Moles and Mass**

**n = m / M**

where n = moles, m = mass (g), M = molar mass (g/mol)

**Example**: How many moles in 36 g of H₂O?
- n = 36 g / 18 g/mol = 2 moles

**Stoichiometric Calculations**

**Step-by-step process**:
1. Write balanced equation
2. Convert given mass to moles
3. Use molar ratio from equation
4. Convert result to desired unit

**Example**: **CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O**
How many grams of CO₂ are produced from 16 g of CH₄?

Step 1: Balanced equation given
Step 2: Moles of CH₄ = 16 g / 16 g/mol = 1 mole
Step 3: From equation: 1 mol CH₄ → 1 mol CO₂
        So 1 mole CH₄ → 1 mole CO₂
Step 4: Mass of CO₂ = 1 mol × 44 g/mol = 44 g

**Limiting Reagent**

The limiting reagent is the reactant that is completely consumed, limiting product formation.

**Example**: **H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl**
If 4 moles H₂ and 1 mole Cl₂ are available:
- H₂ requires: 4 moles ÷ 1 = 4 equivalents
- Cl₂ requires: 1 mole ÷ 1 = 1 equivalent
- Cl₂ is limiting (less available)
- Produces: 1 × 2 = 2 moles HCl (limited by Cl₂)

**Percentage Yield**

**% Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) × 100%**

Theoretical yield: maximum possible from stoichiometry
Actual yield: amount obtained experimentally

**Example**: Theoretical yield = 50 g, actual yield = 40 g
% Yield = (40 / 50) × 100 = 80%

**Nigerian Context**: In fertilizer production at Dangote facility, percentage yield determines efficiency and profitability


### 3.4: Energy in Chemical Reactions

*Duration: 15 minutes*

**Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions**

**Exothermic Reactions**
- Release energy (usually as heat)
- Energy flows OUT of system
- Products have less energy than reactants
- Temperature of surroundings increases
- ΔH is negative (-)
- Common examples: combustion, neutralization, condensation

**Equation notation**: **Reactants → Products + Energy**

Example: **CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O + 890 kJ**
(Burning methane releases 890 kJ per mole)

**Examples**:
- Combustion: Fuel + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + heat
- Neutralization: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O + heat
- Rusting: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ + heat

---

**Endothermic Reactions**
- Absorb energy (usually from surroundings)
- Energy flows INTO system
- Products have more energy than reactants
- Temperature of surroundings decreases
- ΔH is positive (+)
- Examples: melting, boiling, photosynthesis, many decompositions

**Equation notation**: **Reactants + Energy → Products**

Example: **2HgO (heat)→ 2Hg + O₂**
(Decomposition requires heat input)

**Examples**:
- Photosynthesis: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
- Melting: Ice + heat → Water
- Decomposition: CaCO₃ + heat → CaO + CO₂

**Energy Diagrams**

Energy diagrams show relative energy of reactants and products:
- **Exothermic**: Products lower than reactants (downward slope)
- **Endothermic**: Products higher than reactants (upward slope)
- **Activation Energy**: Minimum energy needed to start reaction

**Catalysts**

A catalyst is a substance that increases reaction rate without being consumed:
- Lowers activation energy
- Speeds up reaction
- Not included in balanced equation (written above arrow)
- Examples: MnO₂ in H₂O₂ decomposition, Pt in catalytic converters

**Example**: **2H₂O₂ (MnO₂)→ 2H₂O + O₂**
(MnO₂ speeds up decomposition but isn't consumed)

**Nigerian Context**: In Lagos petroleum refineries, catalysts speed up crude oil cracking and refining processes, reducing energy requirements and time.


## Worked Examples

Step 2: Try coefficient 2 for Fe: 2Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃
- Fe: 2 left, 2 right ✓
- O: 2 left, 3 right ✗

Step 3: Try coefficient 3/2 for O₂: 2Fe + (3/2)O₂ → Fe₂O₃
- Fe: 2 left, 2 right ✓
- O: 3 left, 3 right ✓

Step 4: Clear fractions by multiplying all by 2:
4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

Verify: Fe: 4 = 4 ✓; O: 6 = 6 ✓

Balanced equation: **4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃**
```

**Skills Tested**: Equation balancing, Stoichiometric coefficients, Atom conservation


### Example 3.2: Stoichiometric Mass Calculation: Ammonia Production

**Context**: Ammonia (NH₃) is produced from nitrogen and hydrogen in Nigerian fertilizer plants.

**Problem**: **N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃** If 14 g N₂ reacts, how many grams of NH₃ are produced?

**Solution**:
```
Given: 14 g N₂
Find: Mass of NH₃

Step 1: Calculate molar masses
- N₂: 14 × 2 = 28 g/mol
- NH₃: (14 + 3) = 17 g/mol

Step 2: Convert N₂ to moles
n(N₂) = 14 g / 28 g/mol = 0.5 mol

Step 3: Use molar ratio from equation
From equation: 1 mol N₂ → 2 mol NH₃
0.5 mol N₂ → 0.5 × 2 = 1 mol NH₃

Step 4: Convert NH₃ moles to grams
m(NH₃) = 1 mol × 17 g/mol = 17 g

Answer: 17 g of NH₃ produced
```

**Solution**:
```
Reaction type:
- Substance (C₈H₁₈) reacts with O₂
- Produces CO₂ and H₂O
- This is a COMBUSTION reaction

Energy analysis:
- Combustion reactions are EXOTHERMIC
- Energy is released
- Equation written: 2C₈H₁₈ + 25O₂ → 16CO₂ + 18H₂O + energy
- ΔH is negative (-)
- Typical: ~2,850 kJ released per mole of octane
