## Content


### 3.1: Concept of Force and Mass vs. Weight

*Duration: 15 minutes*

**What is Force?**

A force is a push or pull that can change the state of motion of an object. Force is a vector quantity with both magnitude and direction.

**Effects of Force**:
1. **Change velocity** (speed up, slow down, or change direction)
2. **Change shape** (deform objects)
3. **Start or stop motion** (overcome inertia)

**Unit of Force**: Newton (N)
- 1 Newton = 1 kg·m/s²
- This is the SI unit of force

**Mass vs. Weight**

**Mass**:
- Amount of matter in an object
- Scalar quantity (magnitude only)
- Constant everywhere (same on Earth, Moon, Mars, space)
- Unit: kilograms (kg)
- Measured with a balance scale

**Weight**:
- Gravitational force acting on an object
- Vector quantity (has direction—always downward)
- Varies with location (different on Earth, Moon, Mars)
- Unit: Newtons (N)
- Measured with a spring scale

**Relationship**: W = mg
where:
- W = weight (N)
- m = mass (kg)
- g = gravitational field strength ≈ 9.8 m/s² (≈ 10 m/s²)

**Example**:
A student has mass 60 kg
- On Earth: W = 60 × 10 = 600 N
- On Moon (g ≈ 1.6 m/s²): W = 60 × 1.6 = 96 N
- In space: W = 0 N

The student's mass remains 60 kg everywhere.

**Nigerian Context**: When buying groceries in Nigeria, the shopkeeper weighs items in kilograms (mass). But the scale reading actually shows the normal force (related to weight). A 1 kg bag of rice weighs about 10 N on Earth.


### 3.2: Newton's First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia)

*Duration: 15 minutes*

**Newton's First Law**:

"An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced (net) force."

This is the **Law of Inertia**.

**What is Inertia?**

Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. Objects with greater mass have greater inertia (harder to move or stop).

**Key Principle**: A net force of zero means no acceleration. The object either:
- Remains at rest, OR
- Continues moving at constant velocity

**Balanced vs. Unbalanced Forces**:

**Balanced Forces**:
- Equal and opposite forces
- Net force = 0
- No acceleration (object remains as is)
- Example: A book resting on a table
  - Weight (downward) = Normal force (upward)
  - Net force = 0, book stays at rest

**Unbalanced Forces**:
- Forces don't cancel out
- Net force ≠ 0
- Acceleration occurs
- Example: Pushing a car
  - Applied force > Friction
  - Net force forward, car accelerates

**Real-World Examples**:

1. **Seatbelts in Cars**: When a car suddenly stops, the car experiences unbalanced force (braking). Without a seatbelt, the passenger (experiencing no braking force initially) continues forward due to inertia. The seatbelt provides the force to decelerate the passenger with the car.

2. **Nigerian Markets**: A trader carrying goods on their head tends to continue moving at constant speed due to inertia. When they suddenly stop, the goods want to keep moving (this is why goods can fall if stopped abruptly).

3. **Spacecraft**: In the vacuum of space, with no friction, an object launched forward continues indefinitely at the same velocity without any additional force needed.


### 3.3: Newton's Second Law of Motion (F = ma)

*Duration: 20 minutes*

**Newton's Second Law**:

"The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass."

**Formula**: F_net = ma

where:
- F_net = net force (N)
- m = mass (kg)
- a = acceleration (m/s²)

**Rearranged Forms**:
- a = F_net / m (acceleration from force and mass)
- m = F_net / a (mass from force and acceleration)

**Understanding the Relationships**:

1. **Directly Proportional to Force**:
   - Double the force → double the acceleration
   - Example: Pushing a cart twice as hard makes it accelerate twice as much

2. **Inversely Proportional to Mass**:
   - Double the mass → half the acceleration (for same force)
   - Example: Same force applied to a heavier cart causes less acceleration

3. **Combining Forces**:
When multiple forces act, find the net force (vector sum):
F_net = F₁ + F₂ + F₃ + ...

**Example 1: Calculating Force**

A 1000 kg car accelerates at 2 m/s². What force is needed?
F = ma
F = 1000 × 2 = 2000 N

**Example 2: Calculating Acceleration**

A 50 kg student pushes a 10 kg crate with 100 N force. Assume no friction. What is the acceleration?
a = F / m
a = 100 / 10 = 10 m/s²

**Example 3: Effect of Mass (Nigerian Context)**

Two lorries: one carrying sand (5000 kg), one empty (2000 kg). Both are pushed by engines exerting 10,000 N force.
- Loaded lorry: a = 10,000 / 5000 = 2 m/s²
- Empty lorry: a = 10,000 / 2000 = 5 m/s²

The empty lorry accelerates faster because it has less mass.

**Forces in Different Directions**:

When forces act at angles, we must consider their components and find the net force vectorially. This typically requires resolving into components (covered in vector chapters).


### 3.4: Newton's Third Law and Friction

*Duration: 20 minutes*

**Newton's Third Law**:

"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."

Or more formally: "If object A exerts a force on object B, then object B simultaneously exerts a force on object A that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction."

**Key Points**:
- Forces always come in pairs (action-reaction pairs)
- The two forces are:
  - Equal in magnitude
  - Opposite in direction
  - Acting on different objects
  - Of the same type (both contact or both field forces)

**Examples of Action-Reaction Pairs**:

1. **Walking**: You push the ground backward (action). The ground pushes you forward (reaction). This forward push propels you.

2. **Ball Thrown at Wall**: Ball pushes wall (action). Wall pushes ball back (reaction).

3. **Rocket Launch**: Rocket expels hot gas downward (action). Gas pushes rocket upward (reaction).

4. **Nigerian Context - Fishing Boat**: Fisherman pushes water backward with oar (action). Water pushes boat forward (reaction).

**Friction**

Friction is a contact force that opposes motion between surfaces.

**Types of Friction**:

1. **Static Friction** (f_s):
   - Acts on stationary objects
   - Prevents motion from starting
   - Can vary from 0 to maximum value
   - Formula: f_s ≤ μ_s × N
   - Where μ_s = coefficient of static friction, N = normal force

2. **Kinetic Friction** (f_k):
   - Acts on moving objects
   - Opposes the motion
   - Constant magnitude (for given surfaces and normal force)
   - Formula: f_k = μ_k × N
   - Where μ_k = coefficient of kinetic friction
   - Usually: μ_k < μ_s (easier to keep sliding than start sliding)

**Factors Affecting Friction**:
- **Nature of surfaces**: Rough surfaces have higher friction
- **Normal force**: More contact force → more friction
- **NOT affected by**: Surface area or speed (for kinetic friction)

**Example 1: Static Friction (Nigerian Shop)**

A 40 kg crate of goods sits on a shop floor. The coefficient of static friction is 0.5.
- Normal force N = weight = 40 × 10 = 400 N
- Max static friction = 0.5 × 400 = 200 N

If the shopkeeper pushes with 150 N, the crate doesn't move (friction adjusts to 150 N).
If the shopkeeper pushes with 250 N, the crate moves (applied force exceeds max static friction).

**Example 2: Kinetic Friction (Vehicle on Road)**

A 1000 kg car sliding on wet Lagos road with coefficient of kinetic friction 0.6.
- Normal force = 1000 × 10 = 10,000 N
- Kinetic friction = 0.6 × 10,000 = 6000 N

This friction force opposes the motion and causes deceleration:
a = -6000 / 1000 = -6 m/s² (negative = slowing down)

**Benefits and Problems of Friction**:

**Benefits**:
- Allows walking and running
- Enables vehicles to grip roads
- Braking system relies on friction

**Problems**:
- Causes wear on machinery
- Reduces efficiency of motors
- Requires energy to overcome

**Reducing Friction**:
- Oil/lubrication in machinery
- Smooth surfaces
- Air cushion (hovercraft)


### 3.5: Applying Newton's Laws to Solve Problems

*Duration: 15 minutes*

**Problem-Solving Strategy**:

1. **Identify what's happening**: Read carefully and visualize the situation
2. **Draw a free-body diagram (FBD)**: Show all forces acting on the object
3. **Choose a coordinate system**: Usually horizontal (x) and vertical (y)
4. **Resolve forces**: Find components if forces are at angles
5. **Apply Newton's Second Law**: F_net = ma in each direction
6. **Solve the equations**: Use algebra to find unknowns
7. **Check**: Does the answer make physical sense?

**Example 1: Lifting Force (Nigerian Construction)**

Workers use a pulley system to lift a 200 kg load of concrete. If the rope tension is 2500 N:

Free-body diagram shows:
- Tension (upward) = 2500 N
- Weight (downward) = 200 × 10 = 2000 N

Net force = 2500 - 2000 = 500 N (upward)
Acceleration = 500 / 200 = 2.5 m/s² (upward)

Interpretation: The load accelerates upward at 2.5 m/s².

**Example 2: Motion on an Incline**

A 50 kg crate slides down a frictionless ramp inclined at 30°.

Component of weight along the ramp:
F = mg sin(30°) = 50 × 10 × 0.5 = 250 N

Acceleration down ramp:
a = F / m = 250 / 50 = 5 m/s²

Interpretation: The crate accelerates down the ramp at 5 m/s².

**Example 3: Combined Forces with Friction**

A 1000 kg car accelerates from rest. Engine provides 5000 N force. Friction opposes with 2000 N.

Net force = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 N
Acceleration = 3000 / 1000 = 3 m/s²

To reach 20 m/s:
Time = v / a = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.7 seconds

Interpretation: Despite friction, the net forward force produces acceleration.


## Worked Examples


### Example 3.1: Calculating Weight and Understanding Mass-Weight Difference

**Context**: A Nigerian teacher discussing weight with students. A sack of rice has mass 50 kg.

**Problem**: Calculate the weight of the sack on Earth. What would it be on the Moon? What's the difference between mass and weight?

**Solution**:
```
On Earth:
W = mg = 50 × 10 = 500 N

On Moon (g = 1.6 m/s²):
W = mg = 50 × 1.6 = 80 N

Difference:
- Mass = 50 kg everywhere (constant property of matter)
- Weight = force due to gravity, changes with location
- On Moon, the rice weighs less but has same mass
- This is why astronauts seem lighter on Moon but have same body mass

Interpretation: Weight depends on gravity; mass is intrinsic. A 50 kg person weighs 500 N on Earth but only 80 N on the Moon!
```

**Skills Tested**: Weight calculation, Mass-weight distinction, Effect of gravity


### Example 3.2: Applying Newton's Second Law (Vehicle Acceleration)

**Context**: A Nigerian taxi driver wants to understand how much force their engine provides. The taxi has mass 1500 kg and accelerates from rest to 20 m/s in 8 seconds.

**Problem**: Calculate the net force provided by the engine (ignoring air resistance for simplicity)

**Solution**:
```
Given:
- Mass (m) = 1500 kg
- Initial velocity (u) = 0 m/s
- Final velocity (v) = 20 m/s
- Time (t) = 8 s

Step 1: Find acceleration
a = (v - u) / t = (20 - 0) / 8 = 2.5 m/s²

Step 2: Apply F = ma
F_net = 1500 × 2.5 = 3750 N

Interpretation: The engine must provide at least 3750 N of force to overcome friction and accelerate the taxi. In reality, the engine provides more force, but some is lost to friction and air resistance.

Interpretation: This net 3750 N force produces the observed acceleration.
```

**Skills Tested**: Newton's Second Law, Force calculation, Using kinematic equations


### Example 3.3: Friction and Motion (Sliding Crate Problem)

**Context**: A warehouse worker in Lagos drags a crate of goods across the floor. The crate has mass 100 kg, and the coefficient of kinetic friction with the warehouse floor is 0.4.

**Problem**: Find the friction force. If the worker pulls with 600 N force, what is the acceleration?

**Solution**:
```
Given:
- Mass (m) = 100 kg
- Coefficient of kinetic friction (μ_k) = 0.4
- Applied force (F_applied) = 600 N
- g = 10 m/s²

Step 1: Find normal force (assuming horizontal floor)
N = Weight = mg = 100 × 10 = 1000 N

Step 2: Find friction force
f_k = μ_k × N = 0.4 × 1000 = 400 N

Step 3: Find net force
F_net = F_applied - f_k = 600 - 400 = 200 N

Step 4: Find acceleration
a = F_net / m = 200 / 100 = 2 m/s²

Interpretation: The friction force of 400 N opposes motion. The net forward force of 200 N causes the crate to accelerate at 2 m/s².
```

**Skills Tested**: Friction calculation, Applying Newton's Second Law, Vector addition of forces

## Glossary


**Force**: A push or pull that can change motion, direction, or shape of an object. Vector quantity, unit: Newton (N).

- *Example*: Pushing a car, gravity pulling on objects, magnetic force


**Mass**: Amount of matter in an object; constant everywhere. Scalar quantity, unit: kilogram (kg).

- *Example*: A 60 kg person has same mass on Earth and Moon


**Weight**: Gravitational force acting on an object; changes with location. Vector quantity, unit: Newton (N).

- *Example*: 500 N on Earth, but only 80 N on Moon


**Inertia**: Resistance of an object to changes in its motion. Larger mass means larger inertia.

**Friction**: Contact force opposing motion between surfaces. Static (prevents motion) and kinetic (opposes motion).

- *Example*: Walking (static friction), sliding (kinetic friction)


**Coefficient of Friction**: Dimensionless number describing how much friction exists between two surfaces.

- *Example*: Ice on ice ≈ 0.02 (very slippery); rubber on concrete ≈ 0.7 (high friction)


**Action-Reaction Pair**: Two equal and opposite forces acting on different objects (Newton's Third Law)

- *Example*: Push wall, wall pushes back; rocket expels gas, gas pushes rocket
