### 1.1: What Are Physical Quantities?

*Duration: 15 minutes*

A physical quantity is any observable property of matter or energy that can be measured. In physics, we systematically study the natural world by measuring things like how far objects move, how long an action takes, how hot something is, and how much matter it contains.

Every physical quantity consists of two parts:
1. **Numerical value** (the amount)
2. **Unit of measurement** (the standard we're comparing to)

For example:
- Distance: 5 meters (5 is the value; meter is the unit)
- Time: 45 seconds (45 is the value; second is the unit)
- Mass: 2.5 kilograms (2.5 is the value; kilogram is the unit)
- Temperature: 25 degrees Celsius (25 is the value; degree Celsius is the unit)

Without stating the unit, a numerical value is meaningless. Saying "the distance is 5" is incomplete—5 what? Meters? Kilometers? Centimeters? The unit completes the meaning.

**Why Standardization Matters in Nigeria**
In Nigeria, as in all countries, standardized units ensure clear communication. Whether you're a pharmacist in Lagos measuring medicine, an engineer in Enugu designing a bridge, or a trader in a Kano market calculating fuel volumes, everyone must use the same units so that measurements are universally understood and comparable.

**Two Categories of Physical Quantities:**
1. **Fundamental (or Base) Quantities**: Cannot be defined in terms of other quantities
2. **Derived Quantities**: Defined using fundamental quantities


### 1.2: Fundamental Physical Quantities and SI Units

*Duration: 20 minutes*

The **International System of Units (SI)** is the modern standardized system used worldwide, including in Nigeria. It is based on seven fundamental quantities and their corresponding base units.

**The Seven Fundamental Quantities and SI Units:**

| Quantity | SI Unit | Symbol | Definition |
|----------|---------|--------|------------|
| Length | Meter | m | Distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second |
| Mass | Kilogram | kg | Mass of the international prototype kilogram |
| Time | Second | s | Duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of cesium-133 radiation |
| Electric Current | Ampere | A | Charge flow of 1 coulomb per second |
| Temperature | Kelvin | K | 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of water's triple point |
| Amount of Substance | Mole | mol | Number of atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon-12 |
| Luminous Intensity | Candela | cd | Light intensity of a specific frequency |

**Understanding These Units in a Nigerian Context**

*Length (Meter)*: In Nigerian construction, the meter is standard. A typical room might be 5 m × 4 m. A footballer kicks the ball 50 m down the field.

*Mass (Kilogram)*: Food is sold by kilogram in Nigerian markets. A bag of rice weighs 50 kg. A person typically weighs between 50–100 kg.

*Time (Second)*: Modern devices in Nigeria, from traffic lights to internet speeds, operate on seconds. Nigerians synchronize events to the second.

*Temperature (Kelvin and Celsius)*: Nigerians typically use Celsius for daily temperature. 25°C is comfortable room temperature; 37°C is body temperature. Kelvin (K) is used in physics calculations: K = °C + 273.15

*Electric Current (Ampere)*: Electricians in Nigeria understand amp ratings for household devices. A typical home outlet supplies 15–20 amperes.

**Other Common Derived Units from These Seven Fundamental Units**


### 1.3: Derived Quantities and Units

*Duration: 20 minutes*

Derived quantities are defined using combinations of fundamental quantities through mathematical relationships.

**Common Derived Quantities:**

| Derived Quantity | Definition | SI Unit | Symbol |
|------------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Area | Length × Length | square meter | m² |
| Volume | Length × Length × Length | cubic meter | m³ |
| Speed/Velocity | Distance ÷ Time | meter per second | m/s |
| Acceleration | Change in velocity ÷ Time | meter per second squared | m/s² |
| Force | Mass × Acceleration | Newton | N (= kg⋅m/s²) |
| Density | Mass ÷ Volume | kilogram per cubic meter | kg/m³ |
| Pressure | Force ÷ Area | Pascal | Pa (= N/m²) |
| Work/Energy | Force × Distance | Joule | J (= N⋅m) |
| Power | Work ÷ Time | Watt | W (= J/s) |

**Examples in Nigerian Daily Life**

*Density*: Gold is much denser than water. 1 cm³ of gold weighs about 19 grams, while 1 cm³ of water weighs 1 gram. This is why gold nuggets feel surprisingly heavy for their size.

*Pressure*: When you inflate car tires in Nigeria, the pressure is measured in Pascal or atmospheres. A typical car tire runs at about 200 kPa (2 atmospheres). A more inflated tire distributes the car's weight over the road more effectively.

*Power*: A Nigerian electrical engineer rates household appliances in watts. A typical ceiling fan uses 60–80 W, while an air conditioner uses 1000–2000 W. The more watts, the more electricity it consumes and the higher your NEPA bill.

*Speed*: On Nigerian highways, speed limits are posted in kilometers per hour (km/h). A typical speed limit is 100 km/h, which equals about 27.8 m/s. Understanding m/s is essential in physics for calculating motion.


### 1.4: Unit Prefixes and Unit Conversion

*Duration: 15 minutes*

For very large or very small quantities, we use prefixes to scale units. This makes numbers more manageable.

**Common SI Prefixes**

| Prefix | Symbol | Factor | Meaning |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| Tera | T | 10¹² | One trillion |
| Giga | G | 10⁹ | One billion |
| Mega | M | 10⁶ | One million |
| Kilo | k | 10³ | One thousand |
| (base) | — | 10⁰ | One |
| Milli | m | 10⁻³ | One thousandth |
| Micro | μ | 10⁻⁶ | One millionth |
| Nano | n | 10⁻⁹ | One billionth |
| Pico | p | 10⁻¹² | One trillionth |

**Examples in Nigeria**

- **Kilogram (kg)**: A bag of cement weighs 50 kg (= 50,000 g). In construction, it's easier to say "50 kg" than "50,000 grams."
- **Millimeter (mm)**: Medical precision: a syringe needle thickness is about 0.7 mm (= 0.0007 m).
- **Micrometer (μm)**: Microchip fabrication in future Nigerian electronics industries will use micrometers.
- **Kilometer (km)**: Road signs in Nigeria show distances in kilometers. "Lagos to Ibadan is 120 km." (= 120,000 m)
- **Nanometer (nm)**: Viruses and bacteria are measured in nanometers; some are 100 nm in diameter.

**Unit Conversion Process**

To convert units, multiply by a conversion factor equal to 1.

Example 1: Convert 5 km to meters
- 5 km × (1000 m / 1 km) = 5 × 1000 m = 5000 m
- The fraction (1000 m / 1 km) equals 1 because 1 km = 1000 m

Example 2: Convert 250 mm to meters
- 250 mm × (1 m / 1000 mm) = 250 / 1000 m = 0.25 m

Example 3: Convert 72 km/h to m/s (common for understanding Nigerian traffic)
- 72 km/h = 72 × (1000 m) / (3600 s) = 72,000 m / 3600 s = 20 m/s
- A car traveling at 72 km/h is moving at 20 meters every second.


### 1.5: Measuring Instruments and Accuracy

*Duration: 15 minutes*

Different physical quantities require different measuring instruments. Each instrument has a limit of accuracy.

**Common Measuring Instruments**

| Quantity | Instrument | Typical Range | Accuracy |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Length | Meter ruler | 0–1 m | ±0.5 mm |
| | Measuring tape | 0–50 m | ±1 mm |
| | Vernier caliper | 0–150 mm | ±0.05 mm |
| | Micrometer | 0–25 mm | ±0.01 mm |
| Mass | Balance (beam) | 0–500 g | ±0.1 g |
| | Electronic balance | 0–5 kg | ±0.01 g |
| Time | Stopwatch | 0–unlimited | ±0.01 s |
| | Smartphone timer | 0–unlimited | ±0.1 s |
| Temperature | Thermometer (alcohol) | –10°C to 110°C | ±1°C |
| | Thermometer (digital) | –20°C to 50°C | ±0.1°C |
| Volume | Measuring cylinder | 10 mL–1000 mL | ±1–5 mL |
| | Graduated pipette | 0–25 mL | ±0.1 mL |

**Precision vs. Accuracy**

- **Precision**: How close repeated measurements are to each other. A precise instrument gives consistent results.
- **Accuracy**: How close a measurement is to the true value. An accurate instrument gives the correct result.

A scale might be precise (always showing the same weight for the same object) but not accurate (if it's miscalibrated, the reading is consistently wrong).

**Significant Figures and Uncertainty**

When you measure something, your reading includes:
1. Certain digits (based on the instrument's graduations)
2. One uncertain digit (your best estimate between the smallest divisions)

Example: A ruler marked in millimeters. If you measure a pencil and estimate it's between 15 cm and 16 cm, closer to 15.6 cm, you would record: **15.6 cm** (three significant figures, with the last digit uncertain).

**Rules for Significant Figures**

1. All nonzero digits are significant: 456 has 3 sig figs
2. Zeros between nonzero digits are significant: 405 has 3 sig figs
3. Leading zeros are not significant: 0.045 has 2 sig figs
4. Trailing zeros after a decimal point are significant: 12.50 has 4 sig figs
5. Trailing zeros without a decimal point may not be significant: 1200 has 2, 3, or 4 sig figs (ambiguous—use scientific notation to clarify: 1.2 × 10³ has 2 sig figs)

**Example in Nigerian Context**: A pharmacist measures 15 mL of cough syrup. The graduated cylinder shows graduations every 1 mL. The pharmacist can confidently read the first two digits (15) but must estimate the tenths place, recording 15.0 mL (three significant figures). If they record "15.00 mL," that implies false precision the instrument cannot provide.


## Worked Examples


### Example 2.1: Converting Speed: From Daily Life to Physics

**Context**: A Nigerian driver notes their car's speedometer shows 90 km/h. In physics problems, we need speed in m/s. What is the car's speed?

**Problem**: Convert 90 km/h to m/s

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Identify the conversion factors
- 1 km = 1000 m
- 1 h = 3600 s

Step 2: Set up the conversion
90 km/h = 90 × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 h / 3600 s)
        = 90 × 1000 m / 3600 s
        = 90,000 m / 3600 s
        = 25 m/s

Alternative: Divide by 3.6
90 km/h ÷ 3.6 = 25 m/s (because 3600 s / 1000 m = 3.6)

Interpretation: The car travels 25 meters every second.
```

**Skills Tested**: Unit conversion, Prefix understanding, Factor-label method


### Example 2.2: Calculating Density: Gold vs. Aluminum

**Context**: A Nigerian engineer compares two metals. Gold has a density of 19,300 kg/m³. Aluminum has a density of 2700 kg/m³. What does this mean?

**Problem**: A block of gold measures 10 cm × 5 cm × 5 cm. What is its mass?

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Calculate volume
V = length × width × height
V = 10 cm × 5 cm × 5 cm = 250 cm³

Step 2: Convert to m³
250 cm³ = 250 × (1 m / 100 cm)³ = 250 × 10⁻⁶ m³ = 2.5 × 10⁻⁴ m³

Step 3: Use density formula
Density = Mass / Volume
Mass = Density × Volume
Mass = 19,300 kg/m³ × 2.5 × 10⁻⁴ m³
Mass = 4.825 kg (about 4.8 kg or 4800 grams)

Interpretation: A gold block the size of a large sugar cube weighs almost 5 kilograms! This is why gold is so valuable for its compact density.
```

**Skills Tested**: Volume calculation, Unit conversion to m³, Derived quantity application


### Example 2.3: Reading a Thermometer: Nigerian Classroom Context

**Context**: A science lab in a Nigerian school has an alcohol thermometer. The liquid level sits between the 24°C and 25°C marks, appearing to be at 24.6°C. How should this be recorded?

**Problem**: What is the temperature reading with proper significant figures?

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Identify certain digits
The thermometer is marked to 1°C intervals. We can confidently read 24°C.

Step 2: Estimate the uncertain digit
The liquid appears about 60% of the way between 24°C and 25°C, so we estimate 0.6°C.

Step 3: Record with proper significant figures
Temperature = 24.6°C (three significant figures)

Explanation: The '2' and '4' are certain. The '6' (in the tenths place) is our best estimate and is uncertain. Reporting 24.60°C would imply false precision—we cannot read to the hundredths of a degree with this thermometer.
```

**Skills Tested**: Instrument reading, Significant figures, Measurement uncertainty
