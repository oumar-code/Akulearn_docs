### 3.1: Introduction to Algebraic Expressions

*Duration: 12 minutes*

An **algebraic expression** is a mathematical phrase that contains variables (letters), constants (numbers), and operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

**Components of Algebraic Expressions**:

1. **Variables**: Letters (a, b, x, y, etc.) that represent unknown or changing quantities
2. **Coefficients**: Numbers that multiply variables (in 3x, 3 is the coefficient)
3. **Constants**: Numbers that stand alone (in 3x + 5, 5 is a constant)
4. **Terms**: Parts of an expression separated by + or - signs
5. **Like Terms**: Terms with the same variable(s) and powers (3x and 7x are like terms; 3x² and 3x are not)

**Examples**:
- 2x + 5 (two terms: 2x and 5)
- 3a² - 4a + 7 (three terms: 3a², -4a, and 7)
- x³y + 2xy² - 5 (three terms with variables x and y)

**Types of Algebraic Expressions**:

- **Monomial**: Single term (5x, 3a²b)
- **Binomial**: Two terms (x + 3, 2a - b)
- **Trinomial**: Three terms (x² + 3x + 2)
- **Polynomial**: Multiple terms (4x³ + 3x² - 2x + 1)

**Evaluating Algebraic Expressions**:

To find the value of an expression, substitute numbers for variables:
Example: If x = 3, evaluate 2x + 5
2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11

**Nigerian Context**: Traders use algebraic expressions to calculate profits. If an item costs ₦n and profit per item is ₦50, the profit from selling m items is 50m. Using algebra, they can predict earnings for different quantities.


### 3.2: Simplification and Combining Like Terms

*Duration: 18 minutes*

Simplifying algebraic expressions means combining like terms to make the expression shorter and easier to work with.

**Process**:
1. Identify like terms (same variables with same powers)
2. Add or subtract their coefficients
3. Keep the variable part unchanged

**Examples**:

Simplify: 3x + 5x - 2x
- All terms have x with power 1
- 3x + 5x - 2x = (3 + 5 - 2)x = 6x

Simplify: 2a² + 3a - 5a + 4a²
- Group like terms: (2a² + 4a²) + (3a - 5a)
- Combine: 6a² - 2a

Simplify: 3xy + 5y² - 2xy + y² - 4y²
- Group: (3xy - 2xy) + (5y² + y² - 4y²)
- Combine: xy + 2y²

**Simplifying with Negative Signs**:

When subtracting expressions, distribute the minus sign:
Simplify: (3x + 2y) - (x - 4y)
= 3x + 2y - x + 4y
= (3x - x) + (2y + 4y)
= 2x + 6y

**Order of Operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS)**:

When simplifying, remember:
1. **B**rackets (Parentheses)
2. **O**rders (Powers and roots)
3. **D**ivision and **M**ultiplication (left to right)
4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

Example: Simplify 2 × 3a + 4
= 6a + 4 (Multiply first, then add)


### 3.3: Expanding Brackets (Distributive Property)

*Duration: 25 minutes*

**Distributive Law**: Multiplying a number by a bracketed expression means multiplying it by each term inside:
**a(b + c) = ab + ac**
**a(b - c) = ab - ac**

**Single Brackets**:

Example 1: Expand 3(2x + 5)
= 3 × 2x + 3 × 5
= 6x + 15

Example 2: Expand -2(a - 3b)
= -2 × a - 2 × (-3b)
= -2a + 6b
(Note: minus times minus gives plus)

Example 3: Expand 4x(x² + 3x - 2)
= 4x × x² + 4x × 3x - 4x × 2
= 4x³ + 12x² - 8x

**Double Brackets (FOIL Method)**:

When multiplying (a + b)(c + d), multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second:
- **F**irst: a × c
- **O**uter: a × d
- **I**nner: b × c
- **L**ast: b × d

Example 1: Expand (x + 3)(x + 2)
F: x × x = x²
O: x × 2 = 2x
I: 3 × x = 3x
L: 3 × 2 = 6
Result: x² + 2x + 3x + 6 = x² + 5x + 6

Example 2: Expand (2a - 3)(a + 4)
F: 2a × a = 2a²
O: 2a × 4 = 8a
I: -3 × a = -3a
L: -3 × 4 = -12
Result: 2a² + 8a - 3a - 12 = 2a² + 5a - 12

**Special Cases**:

(a + b)² = (a + b)(a + b) = a² + 2ab + b²
Example: (x + 3)² = x² + 6x + 9

(a - b)² = (a - b)(a - b) = a² - 2ab + b²
Example: (x - 2)² = x² - 4x + 4

(a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²
Example: (x + 5)(x - 5) = x² - 25


### 3.4: Factorization

*Duration: 20 minutes*

**Factorization** is the reverse of expansion. It means writing an expression as a product of its factors.

**Method 1: Removing Common Factors**

Find the highest common factor (HCF) of all terms:

Example 1: Factorize 6x + 9
- HCF of 6 and 9 is 3
- 6x + 9 = 3(2x + 3)

Example 2: Factorize 4a² + 6a
- HCF of 4a² and 6a is 2a
- 4a² + 6a = 2a(2a + 3)

Example 3: Factorize 10x²y - 15xy²
- HCF of 10x²y and 15xy² is 5xy
- 10x²y - 15xy² = 5xy(2x - 3y)

**Method 2: Factorizing Quadratic Expressions (ax² + bx + c)**

For x² + bx + c:
1. Find two numbers that multiply to give c and add to give b
2. Write as (x + m)(x + n)

Example: Factorize x² + 5x + 6
- Find two numbers: 2 and 3 (2 × 3 = 6, 2 + 3 = 5)
- x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)

Example: Factorize x² - 4x - 12
- Find two numbers: -6 and 2 (-6 × 2 = -12, -6 + 2 = -4)
- x² - 4x - 12 = (x - 6)(x + 2)

**Method 3: Difference of Two Squares**

a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)

Example 1: Factorize x² - 9
- 9 = 3²
- x² - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)

Example 2: Factorize 4a² - 25
- 4a² = (2a)², 25 = 5²
- 4a² - 25 = (2a + 5)(2a - 5)


## Worked Examples


### Example 3.1: Expanding and Simplifying

**Context**: A student encounters: Expand and simplify 2(x + 3) + 3(x - 1)

**Problem**: Expand and simplify 2(x + 3) + 3(x - 1)

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Expand the first bracket
2(x + 3) = 2x + 6

Step 2: Expand the second bracket
3(x - 1) = 3x - 3

Step 3: Combine the results
2x + 6 + 3x - 3

Step 4: Combine like terms
(2x + 3x) + (6 - 3) = 5x + 3
```

**Skills Tested**: Distributive property, Combining like terms, Working with multiple brackets


### Example 3.2: Expanding Double Brackets

**Context**: A student needs to expand (2x + 3)(x + 4) for a geometry problem

**Problem**: Expand (2x + 3)(x + 4)

**Solution**:
```
Using FOIL method:
F (First): 2x × x = 2x²
O (Outer): 2x × 4 = 8x
I (Inner): 3 × x = 3x
L (Last): 3 × 4 = 12

Combine: 2x² + 8x + 3x + 12
         = 2x² + 11x + 12

Verification: Let x = 1
(2(1) + 3)(1 + 4) = (5)(5) = 25
2(1)² + 11(1) + 12 = 2 + 11 + 12 = 25 ✓
```

**Skills Tested**: FOIL method, Combining like terms, Verification


### Example 3.3: Factorizing (Nigerian Trading Context)

**Context**: A trader in Lagos calculates profit as 8x² + 12x naira, where x is the number of items sold in tens. Factor this to find a common expression.

**Problem**: Factorize 8x² + 12x

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Find the highest common factor
8x² = 4x × 2x
12x = 4x × 3
HCF = 4x

Step 2: Factor out the HCF
8x² + 12x = 4x(2x + 3)

Interpretation: The profit can be expressed as 4x(2x + 3) naira, which shows it's 4x multiplied by (2x + 3).
```

**Skills Tested**: Finding HCF, Factorization, Practical application
