## Content


### 2.1: Introduction to Indices

*Duration: 15 minutes*

An index (or exponent) tells us how many times a number is multiplied by itself.

**Definition**: If a is a number and n is a positive integer, then a^n = a × a × a × ... × a (n times)

We read a^n as "a to the power of n" or "a raised to the power of n"

In the expression a^n:
- **a** is called the base
- **n** is called the index (or exponent, or power)
- **a^n** is called the power

**Examples**:
- 2³ = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 (read as "2 to the power of 3" or "2 cubed")
- 5² = 5 × 5 = 25 (read as "5 to the power of 2" or "5 squared")
- 10⁴ = 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 10,000
- a⁵ = a × a × a × a × a (product of five a's)

**Special Cases**:
- Any number to the power of 1 equals itself: a¹ = a
- Any number to the power of 0 equals 1: a⁰ = 1 (except 0⁰ is undefined)
- The power of 2 is called "squaring": a² means "the square of a"
- The power of 3 is called "cubing": a³ means "the cube of a"

**Nigerian Application**: In banking, if you invest ₦100,000 at 5% compound interest per year, after n years you have ₦100,000 × (1.05)^n. This is why understanding indices is crucial for financial literacy in Nigeria!


### 2.2: Laws of Indices

*Duration: 25 minutes*

There are five main laws of indices that make calculations easier. These laws allow us to simplify expressions without writing out all the multiplications.

**Law 1: Multiplication Rule (Same Base)**
When multiplying powers with the same base, add the exponents:
**a^m × a^n = a^(m+n)**

Example:
2³ × 2⁴ = (2 × 2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2 × 2) = 2⁷ = 128
Or using the law: 2³ × 2⁴ = 2^(3+4) = 2⁷

Example with variables:
x² × x⁵ = x^(2+5) = x⁷

**Law 2: Division Rule (Same Base)**
When dividing powers with the same base, subtract the exponents:
**a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n)**

Example:
5⁶ ÷ 5³ = 5^(6-3) = 5³ = 125

Example with variables:
a⁸ ÷ a³ = a^(8-3) = a⁵

**Law 3: Power of a Power**
When raising a power to another power, multiply the exponents:
**(a^m)^n = a^(mn)**

Example:
(2³)² = 2³ × 2³ = 2⁶ = 64
Or using the law: (2³)² = 2^(3×2) = 2⁶

Example with variables:
(x²)⁵ = x^(2×5) = x¹⁰

**Law 4: Power of a Product**
When raising a product to a power, apply the power to each factor:
**(ab)^n = a^n × b^n**

Example:
(2 × 3)² = 2² × 3² = 4 × 9 = 36
Or directly: (6)² = 36 ✓

Example with variables:
(2xy)³ = 2³ × x³ × y³ = 8x³y³

**Law 5: Power of a Quotient**
When raising a quotient to a power, apply the power to both numerator and denominator:
**(a/b)^n = a^n / b^n** (where b ≠ 0)

Example:
(2/3)² = 2² / 3² = 4/9

Example with variables:
(x/y)³ = x³ / y³


### 2.3: Negative and Fractional Indices

*Duration: 25 minutes*

**Negative Indices**

A negative index means we take the reciprocal (flip the fraction) of the positive power:
**a^(-n) = 1 / a^n** (where a ≠ 0)

Examples:
- 2⁻³ = 1/2³ = 1/8 = 0.125
- 5⁻² = 1/5² = 1/25 = 0.04
- x⁻⁴ = 1/x⁴

Why? Because of the division rule: a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n)
If m < n, we get negative exponents:
2² ÷ 2⁵ = 2^(2-5) = 2⁻³ = 1/2³ ✓

**Fractional Indices**

A fractional index means we take a root:
**a^(1/n) = ⁿ√a** (the nth root of a)

For example:
- a^(1/2) = √a (square root)
- a^(1/3) = ³√a (cube root)
- a^(1/4) = ⁴√a (fourth root)
- a^(1/n) = ⁿ√a (nth root)

General rule:
**a^(m/n) = ⁿ√(a^m) = (ⁿ√a)^m**

Examples:
- 8^(1/3) = ³√8 = 2 (because 2³ = 8)
- 16^(1/2) = √16 = 4
- 27^(2/3) = (³√27)² = 3² = 9
- 32^(2/5) = (⁵√32)² = 2² = 4 (because ⁵√32 = 2)

**Nigerian Context**: In construction, calculating dimensions of cubic rooms, square floors, or scaling architectural designs often requires fractional indices. For example, if a square room has area 100 m², the side length is 100^(1/2) = 10 m.


### 2.4: Scientific Notation

*Duration: 15 minutes*

Scientific notation is a way of writing very large or very small numbers using powers of 10. This is essential in science and engineering.

**Standard Form**: A number in scientific notation is written as:
**a × 10^n** where 1 ≤ a < 10 and n is an integer

The number 'a' is called the mantissa or coefficient, and n is called the exponent or order of magnitude.

**Large Numbers**:
- 50,000 = 5 × 10⁴
- 3,000,000 = 3 × 10⁶
- 256,000,000 = 2.56 × 10⁸

**Small Numbers**:
- 0.005 = 5 × 10⁻³
- 0.00023 = 2.3 × 10⁻⁴
- 0.000000056 = 5.6 × 10⁻⁸

**How to Convert**:
1. Move the decimal point to get a number between 1 and 10
2. Count how many places you moved it
3. If you moved it LEFT, the exponent is positive
4. If you moved it RIGHT, the exponent is negative

Example: Convert 2,450,000 to scientific notation
- Move decimal point 6 places to the left: 2.45
- Scientific notation: 2.45 × 10⁶

**Nigerian/African Examples**:
- Nigeria's population: ~223,000,000 = 2.23 × 10⁸
- Diameter of a bacteria: 0.000001 m = 1 × 10⁻⁶ m
- Distance from Lagos to New York: ~6,100,000 m = 6.1 × 10⁶ m
- Size of a virus: ~0.000000100 m = 1 × 10⁻⁷ m


## Worked Examples


### Example 2.1: Simplifying Expressions Using Laws of Indices

**Context**: A student encounters a complex algebraic expression in a Physics problem about acceleration. They need to simplify (a³ × a²) ÷ a⁴

**Problem**: Simplify (a³ × a²) ÷ a⁴

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Apply Law 1 (multiply same bases, add exponents)
(a³ × a²) = a^(3+2) = a⁵

Step 2: Apply Law 2 (divide same bases, subtract exponents)
a⁵ ÷ a⁴ = a^(5-4) = a¹ = a

Alternatively, using the law directly:
(a³ × a²) ÷ a⁴ = a^(3+2-4) = a¹ = a
```

**Skills Tested**: Laws of Indices, Algebraic simplification, Exponent arithmetic


### Example 2.2: Compound Interest Calculation (Nigerian Banking)

**Context**: A Nigerian student invests ₦50,000 in a savings account at 6% annual compound interest. After 3 years, how much money will they have?

**Problem**: Calculate: 50,000 × (1.06)³

**Solution**:
```
Formula for compound interest:
Final Amount = Principal × (1 + rate)^years

Given:
- Principal = ₦50,000
- Rate = 6% = 0.06
- Years = 3

Calculation:
Final Amount = 50,000 × (1.06)³
            = 50,000 × 1.1910 (calculated)
            = ₦59,550 (approximately)

The student's investment grows by ₦9,550 in 3 years due to compound interest.
```

**Skills Tested**: Powers of decimals, Real-world application, Percentage calculations


### Example 2.3: Fractional Indices in Construction

**Context**: A Nigerian construction company needs to calculate the side length of a square foundation that has an area of 144 m². What is the side length?

**Problem**: Find x where x² = 144, express using fractional indices

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Set up the equation
x² = 144

Step 2: Use fractional indices
Taking the square root (which is the same as raising to power 1/2):
x = 144^(1/2)

Step 3: Calculate
144^(1/2) = √144 = 12

Answer: The side of the square foundation is 12 meters.

Verification: 12² = 12 × 12 = 144 ✓
```

**Skills Tested**: Fractional indices, Square roots, Practical application
