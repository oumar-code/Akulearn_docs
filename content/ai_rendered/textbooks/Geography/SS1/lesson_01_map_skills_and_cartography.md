## Content


### 1.1: Map Basics and Types

*Duration: 20 minutes*

Maps are scaled representations of Earth's surface. **Map elements**: title, legend/key, scale, north arrow, grid, date, source. 

**Common map types**: 
- **Political maps**: boundaries, cities, roads. 
- **Physical maps**: relief, rivers, mountains. 
- **Thematic maps**: show a specific theme (rainfall, population density, land use). 
- **Topographic maps**: detailed physical and man-made features with contours. 

**Nigerian context**: Use physical maps to study Niger River, Benue River, Jos Plateau; political maps for states and LGAs; thematic maps for rainfall and population distribution.


### 1.2: Scale, Distance Calculation, and Map Symbols

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Scale** shows ratio of map distance to ground distance. 
- **Representative Fraction (RF)**: e.g., 1:50,000 means 1 unit on map equals 50,000 on ground. 
- **Linear/Bar scale**: graphic representation. 

**Distance calculation**: Measure with ruler and apply scale. Example: 4 cm on map at 1:100,000 → 4 cm × 100,000 = 400,000 cm = 4,000 m = 4 km. 

**Map symbols**: point (wells, schools), line (roads, rivers), area (forests, lakes). Legends explain symbols. 

**Nigerian context**: Estimating distance Lagos–Ibadan on highway using map scale; interpreting symbols for bridges over Niger River.


### 1.3: Latitude, Longitude, and Coordinates

*Duration: 24 minutes*

**Latitude**: angular distance north/south of Equator (0° to 90° N/S). Lines run east–west. **Longitude**: angular distance east/west of Prime Meridian (0° to 180° E/W). Lines run north–south. 

**Nigeria coordinates**: roughly 4°N–14°N, 3°E–15°E. 

**Using coordinates**: Identify location where a parallel and meridian intersect. 

**Time zones**: Earth rotates 15° per hour; Nigeria ~GMT+1 (1 hour ahead of Greenwich). 

**Navigation**: GPS uses latitude/longitude; pilots and ships rely on coordinates.


### 1.4: Map Projections and Distortions

*Duration: 23 minutes*

Projections transform Earth's curved surface to flat maps. All projections distort at least one property: area, shape, distance, or direction. 

**Common projections**: 
- **Mercator**: preserves direction/shape locally, distorts area (high latitudes enlarged). 
- **Equal-area (Gall-Peters)**: preserves area, distorts shape. 
- **Conic**: good for mid-latitude regions (e.g., Africa sections). 

**Choosing projection** depends on purpose (navigation vs thematic area mapping). 

**Nigerian context**: National topographic maps often use UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) zones covering Nigeria.


## Worked Examples


### Example 1.1: RF Scale Distance

**Context**: Map scale 1:100,000. Distance between two towns on map = 5 cm.

**Problem**: Find ground distance in km.

**Solution**:
```
5 cm × 100,000 = 500,000 cm = 5,000 m = 5 km.
```

**Skills Tested**: Scale conversion, Unit conversion


### Example 1.2: Coordinate Identification

**Context**: Point at 9°N, 8°E on a Nigeria map.

**Problem**: Name a nearby Nigerian city/region.

**Solution**:
```
Around Jos Plateau/Central Nigeria. (Approximate for practice.)
```

**Skills Tested**: Latitude/longitude use, Nigeria spatial awareness


### Example 1.3: Projection Choice

**Context**: A geographer wants to compare land area of Nigerian states accurately.

**Problem**: Which projection type is better and why?

**Solution**:
```
Use an equal-area projection (e.g., Gall-Peters) to preserve area for fair comparison.
```

**Skills Tested**: Projection reasoning, Map purpose alignment


## Practice Problems


### Basic Level


**1.1.B**: What does map scale show?

> **Answer**: Ratio of map distance to ground distance.

> **Explanation**: Scale links map to real world.


**1.2.B**: Lines running east–west are called?

> **Answer**: Lines of latitude (parallels).

> **Explanation**: Latitudes run E–W.


**1.3.B**: Nigeria lies roughly between which latitudes?

> **Answer**: About 4°N to 14°N.

> **Explanation**: Nigeria's north–south span.


### Core Level


**1.4.C**: Convert 3 cm at 1:50,000 to km.

> **Answer**: 3 cm × 50,000 = 150,000 cm = 1,500 m = 1.5 km.

> **Explanation**: Scale and units.


**1.5.C**: Name two thematic map examples.

> **Answer**: Rainfall map, population density map, land use map (any two).

> **Explanation**: Thematic shows one theme.


**1.6.C**: State one property distorted in Mercator projection.

> **Answer**: Area (high latitudes enlarged).

> **Explanation**: Mercator preserves direction, distorts area.


### Challenge Level


**1.7.CH**: If Nigeria spans ~10° latitude, estimate solar time difference from south to north (1° ≈ 4 minutes).

> **Answer**: About 40 minutes difference in solar time.

> **Explanation**: 10° × 4 min/° = 40 min.


**1.8.CH**: Why choose UTM for national mapping?

> **Answer**: UTM minimizes distortion over limited east–west width, gives consistent coordinates in meters for surveying and navigation.

> **Explanation**: Practical, low-distortion over zones.


**1.9.CH**: Explain difference between political and topographic maps.

> **Answer**: Political: boundaries, cities; Topographic: detailed natural/man-made features with contours and elevations.

> **Explanation**: Different purposes.


**1.10.CH**: A bar scale shows 0–5 km length of 2.5 cm. What is the RF?

> **Answer**: 5 km = 500,000 cm. RF = 2.5 cm : 500,000 cm → 1 : 200,000.

> **Explanation**: Compute ratio from bar scale.
