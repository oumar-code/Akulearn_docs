## Content


### 2.1: Weather Elements and Measurement

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**Weather** = short-term atmospheric conditions; **Climate** = long-term average (30+ years). Elements: temperature, precipitation, humidity, pressure, wind, cloud cover, sunshine.

**Instruments**: thermometer (temp), rain gauge (rainfall), hygrometer (humidity), barometer (pressure), anemometer (wind speed), wind vane (direction), sunshine recorder. 

**Nigerian context**: Rainfall heavy in coastal south, lower in Sahel north; harmattan (dry, dusty NE trade winds) lowers visibility and temperature.


### 2.2: Climate Zones and Nigeria's Patterns

*Duration: 23 minutes*

Nigeria spans several climate zones: 
- **Equatorial/Monsoon (south coastal)**: high rainfall, long wet season. 
- **Tropical Wet-and-Dry (Middle Belt)**: distinct wet/dry seasons. 
- **Semi-arid (far north/Sahel)**: low rainfall, high evaporation. 

**Seasonality**: ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone) shifts; rainy season when ITCZ is overhead; dry season with harmattan. 

**Rainfall gradient**: >2000 mm south (Port Harcourt) to <500 mm north (Maiduguri).


### 2.3: Climate Change: Causes and Effects

*Duration: 22 minutes*

Causes: greenhouse gas rise (CO2 from fossil fuels, methane), deforestation, industrial emissions. 

Effects: rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, sea-level rise (threat to Lagos coast), desertification in north, flooding in river basins, impacts on agriculture and health. 

Mitigation: renewable energy, afforestation, efficient transport. 
Adaptation: flood defenses, drought-resistant crops, early warning systems.


### 2.4: Natural Resources and Conservation in Nigeria

*Duration: 23 minutes*

Resources: **Minerals** (oil, gas, coal, tin, limestone, gold), **Agricultural** (cocoa, palm oil, cassava, rice), **Water** (Niger/Benue rivers), **Forest** (timber), **Wildlife**. 

Uses: energy, industry, export revenue, food security. 

Challenges: overexploitation, oil spills, deforestation, illegal mining. 

Conservation strategies: sustainable logging, reforestation, protected areas, pollution control, community resource management.


## Worked Examples


### Example 2.1: Reading Rainfall Data

**Context**: Rainfall (mm): Lagos 2000, Enugu 1700, Abuja 1500, Kano 800, Maiduguri 500.

**Problem**: Which city has semi-arid conditions? Rank from wettest to driest.

**Solution**:
```
Maiduguri (~500 mm) is semi-arid. Order wet to dry: Lagos > Enugu > Abuja > Kano > Maiduguri.
```

**Skills Tested**: Data interpretation, Climate zones


### Example 2.2: Harmattan Impact

**Context**: During harmattan, a school in Kaduna experiences cold mornings and dusty air.

**Problem**: Explain likely wind origin and effects on visibility/health.

**Solution**:
```
Northeast trade winds from Sahara bring dry dust → reduced visibility, respiratory irritation, cooler temperatures.
```

**Skills Tested**: Weather patterns, Health/environment reasoning


### Example 2.3: Resource Management Trade-off

**Context**: A community near a forest considers logging for income versus conserving for water protection and tourism.

**Problem**: State opportunity cost and suggest balanced approach.

**Solution**:
```
Opportunity cost of logging: loss of watershed protection/biodiversity/tourism. Balanced approach: controlled logging, replanting, eco-tourism development, community management to share benefits.
```

**Skills Tested**: Sustainability, Opportunity cost


## Practice Problems


### Basic Level


**2.1.B**: Define weather vs climate.

> **Answer**: Weather = short-term conditions; Climate = long-term average (30+ years).

> **Explanation**: Time scale difference.


**2.2.B**: Name two weather elements.

> **Answer**: Temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind, pressure (any two).

> **Explanation**: Core elements.


**2.3.B**: What wind brings harmattan?

> **Answer**: Dry northeast trade winds from Sahara.

> **Explanation**: Harmattan source.


### Core Level


**2.4.C**: Which Nigerian zone gets highest rainfall?

> **Answer**: Coastal south (e.g., Port Harcourt).

> **Explanation**: Equatorial/monsoon zone.


**2.5.C**: Give one cause of climate change.

> **Answer**: Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels (or deforestation).

> **Explanation**: Anthropogenic drivers.


**2.6.C**: Name one major mineral and one agricultural resource in Nigeria.

> **Answer**: Oil or gas; cocoa/palm oil/cassava/rice (any).

> **Explanation**: Resource categories.


### Challenge Level


**2.7.CH**: Explain how shifting ITCZ affects Nigeria's rainy season timing.

> **Answer**: When ITCZ moves north over region, moist SW winds bring rain; southward retreat ends rains. Timing varies north-south causing different wet season lengths.

> **Explanation**: ITCZ migration controls seasonality.


**2.8.CH**: Suggest two adaptation measures for coastal flooding in Lagos.

> **Answer**: Sea walls/embankments, drainage upgrades, zoning/setbacks, mangrove restoration, early warning systems (any two).

> **Explanation**: Adaptation tools.


**2.9.CH**: Why is deforestation linked to climate change?

> **Answer**: Trees store carbon; cutting releases CO2 and reduces future absorption, raising greenhouse gas levels.

> **Explanation**: Carbon cycle role.


**2.10.CH**: Evaluate one benefit and one cost of large-scale mining in Nigeria.

> **Answer**: Benefit: jobs, revenue, infrastructure. Cost: environmental damage (pollution, deforestation), displacement, health risks.

> **Explanation**: Trade-offs of resource extraction.
