## Content


### 3.1: Population Distribution and Density

*Duration: 22 minutes*

Population distribution = how people are spread; density = people per unit area. 

**Factors influencing distribution**: climate (rainfall, temperature), relief (highlands vs plains), soil fertility, water availability, resources, infrastructure, jobs, security. 

**Nigerian patterns**: Higher densities in Lagos, Kano, Anambra; lower in arid north-east and some riverine/swampy areas.


### 3.2: Migration and Urban Growth

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Migration**: movement of people from one place to another (internal/external; rural-urban, urban-rural). **Push factors**: unemployment, conflict, poor services. **Pull factors**: jobs, education, health, safety. 

**Urbanization**: increasing share of people living in urban areas. Causes: industrialization, services growth, rural push factors. 

**Nigerian context**: Rural–urban migration to Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt for jobs and education; creates pressure on housing, transport, water, waste management.


### 3.3: Cultural Geography and Human-Environment Interaction

*Duration: 22 minutes*

Cultural geography studies how culture varies across space (language, religion, traditions). Nigeria is culturally diverse (Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, many others). 

**Human-environment interaction**: how humans adapt to, modify, and depend on environment. Examples: irrigation in dry zones, deforestation for farming, building flood defenses. 

**Environmental impacts**: urban sprawl, pollution, loss of green areas. Sustainable planning seeks balance.


### 3.4: Sustainable Development and Planning

*Duration: 23 minutes*

Sustainable development meets present needs without harming future generations. 

**Settlement planning**: zoning, transport planning, green spaces, water/waste systems. 

**Nigerian context**: BRT in Lagos to reduce congestion; Abuja planned city layout; need for affordable housing, resilient drainage against floods. 

**SDGs**: links to clean water, sustainable cities, climate action.


## Worked Examples


### Example 3.1: Population Density Calculation

**Context**: State population 5,000,000; area 50,000 km².

**Problem**: Calculate population density.

**Solution**:
```
Density = population / area = 5,000,000 / 50,000 = 100 people per km².
```

**Skills Tested**: Density calculation, Units


### Example 3.2: Push and Pull Factors

**Context**: A young graduate moves from rural Benue to Abuja.

**Problem**: Identify likely push and pull factors.

**Solution**:
```
Push: limited job opportunities, lower wages, fewer services. Pull: better employment, higher wages, universities, healthcare, infrastructure.
```

**Skills Tested**: Migration reasoning, Socioeconomic factors


### Example 3.3: Sustainable Urban Planning Measure

**Context**: A city faces flooding and traffic congestion.

**Problem**: Suggest one sustainable planning measure for each issue.

**Solution**:
```
Flooding: improve drainage, protect wetlands, permeable pavements. Traffic: expand public transit (BRT/light rail), enforce zoning to reduce long commutes.
```

**Skills Tested**: Applied sustainability, Urban planning


## Practice Problems


### Basic Level


**3.1.B**: Define population density.

**3.2.B**: What is migration?

> **Answer**: Movement of people from one place to another to live or work.

> **Explanation**: Basic definition.


**3.3.B**: Name one push and one pull factor for urban migration.

> **Answer**: Push: unemployment; Pull: better jobs (examples vary).

> **Explanation**: Drivers of migration.


### Core Level


**3.4.C**: State one effect of rapid urbanization.

> **Answer**: Housing shortages, traffic congestion, waste management problems (any one).

> **Explanation**: Urban growth effects.


**3.5.C**: Give an example of human-environment interaction.

> **Answer**: Irrigation in dry areas, deforestation for farming, building dams (any).

> **Explanation**: Interaction examples.


**3.6.C**: Mention one Nigerian city experiencing rapid growth.

> **Answer**: Lagos or Abuja (others possible).

> **Explanation**: Urban centers.


### Challenge Level


**3.7.CH**: How can urban sprawl affect the environment?

> **Answer**: Consumes farmland/forests, increases car dependence and emissions, strains water/waste systems.

> **Explanation**: Sprawl impacts.


**3.8.CH**: Suggest two measures to improve sustainability in Lagos transport.

> **Answer**: Expand BRT/rail, promote non-motorized transport (walkways/bike lanes), traffic management, encourage mixed-use zoning.

> **Explanation**: Sustainable mobility.


**3.9.CH**: Give one cultural geography example in Nigeria.

> **Answer**: Distribution of languages (Yoruba SW, Hausa/Fulani North, Igbo SE) or religious patterns (Muslim-majority north, Christian-majority south).

> **Explanation**: Spatial culture patterns.


**3.10.CH**: If a city grows from 1m to 1.5m people in 10 years, what is the average annual growth rate (approx compound)?

> **Answer**: Using (1.5/1)^(1/10)-1 ≈ 0.041 or 4.1% per year.

> **Explanation**: Compound growth estimate.


## Glossary


**Population density**: Number of people per unit area.
