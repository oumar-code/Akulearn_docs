## Content


### 2.1: DNA Structure and Replication

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**DNA Structure**
- Double helix made of two antiparallel strands
- Nucleotides: phosphate + deoxyribose sugar + nitrogen base
- Bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G)
- Base pairing: A pairs with T; C pairs with G

**Replication Basics**
- DNA unwinds; strands separate
- Each original strand guides formation of a new complementary strand
- Ensures genetic information is copied before cell division

**Nigerian Context**: Molecular labs in Abuja use PCR (DNA copying) to diagnose diseases like Lassa fever and COVID-19.


### 2.2: Genes, Proteins, and Traits

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**From Gene to Protein**
- Gene: segment of DNA coding for a protein
- Transcription: DNA → mRNA in nucleus
- Translation: mRNA → protein on ribosomes
- Proteins determine traits (e.g., enzymes, pigments)

**Key Terms**
- Genotype: genetic makeup (e.g., TT, Tt, tt)
- Phenotype: observable trait (e.g., tall, short)
- Homozygous: same alleles (TT or tt)
- Heterozygous: different alleles (Tt)

**Nigerian Context**: Sickle-cell disease (HbS allele) affects many Nigerians; genotype testing helps couples make informed decisions.


### 2.3: Mendelian Inheritance

*Duration: 24 minutes*

**Monohybrid Cross**
- Involves one gene with two alleles (dominant and recessive)
- Dominant allele expressed in heterozygote (Tt shows tall if T is dominant)
- Recessive allele expressed only when homozygous (tt)

**Punnett Square Steps**
1. Identify parental genotypes
2. List possible gametes
3. Fill grid to show offspring combinations
4. Calculate genotype and phenotype ratios

**Examples**
- Tall (TT) × Short (tt) → all Tt (tall) in F1
- Selfing F1 (Tt × Tt) → 3 tall : 1 short phenotype ratio

**Nigerian Context**: Crop breeding programs at IITA Ibadan use Mendelian principles to combine disease resistance and high yield traits in cassava and maize.


### 2.4: Mutation and Genetic Variation

*Duration: 21 minutes*

**Mutation**
- Sudden change in DNA sequence
- Types: substitution, insertion, deletion, chromosomal changes
- Causes: errors in replication, radiation, chemicals

**Effects**
- Neutral: no change in trait
- Beneficial: improved adaptation (e.g., drought-tolerant crop)
- Harmful: genetic disorders

**Variation Importance**
- Provides diversity for natural selection and breeding

**Nigerian Context**: Breeders induce mutations to develop rice varieties tolerant to local flooding; healthcare screens for mutations causing sickle-cell disease and G6PD deficiency.


## Worked Examples


### Example 2.1: Building a Punnett Square

**Context**: A maize breeder crosses heterozygous tall plants (Tt × Tt).

**Problem**: Predict genotype and phenotype ratios for plant height.

**Solution**:
```
Gametes: T and t from each parent. Punnett grid yields TT, Tt, Tt, tt. Genotype ratio 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt. Phenotype ratio 3 tall : 1 short (T is dominant).
```

**Skills Tested**: Punnett square construction, Dominant/recessive reasoning, Ratio calculation


### Example 2.2: Interpreting Genotype Results

**Context**: A Nigerian couple checks sickle-cell status before marriage.

**Problem**: If both are AS, what are possible genotypes for children?

**Solution**:
```
Gametes: A and S from each parent. Punnett outcomes: AA, AS, AS, SS. Probabilities: 25% AA (normal), 50% AS (carrier), 25% SS (sickle-cell disease).
```

**Skills Tested**: Medical genetics, Probability, Punnett interpretation


### Example 2.3: Mutation Impact

**Context**: A single base change in a gene alters an enzyme in cocoa plants.

**Problem**: How could this affect phenotype?

**Solution**:
```
If mutation changes amino acid sequence, enzyme activity may drop, reducing flavor compound production. Could be harmful (lower quality) or occasionally beneficial (new flavor). Shows link between DNA change and trait expression.
```

**Skills Tested**: DNA-protein-trait link, Cause and effect, Agricultural relevance


## Practice Problems


### Basic Level


**2.1.B**: State the base pairing rule in DNA.

> **Answer**: A pairs with T; C pairs with G.

> **Explanation**: Complementary base pairing stabilizes the double helix.


**2.2.B**: What is a gene?

> **Answer**: A segment of DNA that codes for a protein or functional RNA.

> **Explanation**: Genes are instruction units on DNA.


**2.3.B**: Define phenotype.

> **Answer**: Observable characteristics of an organism.

> **Explanation**: Phenotype results from genotype and environment.


### Core Level


**2.4.C**: Differentiate homozygous from heterozygous with an example.

> **Answer**: Homozygous: same alleles (TT or tt); heterozygous: different alleles (Tt).

> **Explanation**: Allele combination determines zygosity.


**2.5.C**: In a Tt × tt cross, what fraction of offspring are tall? (T is dominant)

> **Answer**: 50% tall (Tt); 50% short (tt).

> **Explanation**: Half receive T allele, half receive t only.


**2.6.C**: Explain why mutations are sources of variation.

> **Answer**: They create new DNA sequences and new alleles, introducing differences within populations.

> **Explanation**: Variation arises when gene sequences change.


### Challenge Level


**2.7.CH**: A farmer crosses two hybrid pepper plants (Rr for red color). Predict phenotype ratio.

> **Answer**: 3 red : 1 non-red (if r is recessive).

> **Explanation**: Rr × Rr yields RR, Rr, Rr, rr → three with R express red.


**2.8.CH**: How can a single nucleotide change lead to disease?

> **Answer**: It can alter amino acid sequence, misfold a protein, and disrupt its function (e.g., sickle-cell anemia from valine substitution).

> **Explanation**: Protein structure depends on DNA-coded amino acids.


**2.9.CH**: Explain why carriers of sickle-cell trait (AS) are often healthy.

> **Answer**: They produce enough normal hemoglobin (A) to prevent severe symptoms, though may have mild effects under low oxygen.

> **Explanation**: Dominant normal allele masks most effects of recessive S allele.


**2.10.CH**: Suggest one benefit and one risk of induced mutation in crops.

> **Answer**: Benefit: new traits like drought tolerance; Risk: unintended harmful changes reducing yield or safety.

> **Explanation**: Mutations are random; selection keeps useful ones and removes harmful ones.
