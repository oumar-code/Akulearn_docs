## Content


### 3.1: Ecosystem Organization

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**Key Terms**
- Population: individuals of same species in an area
- Community: different populations interacting
- Ecosystem: community plus abiotic factors (light, soil, water)
- Biome: large region with characteristic climate and organisms

**Nigerian Examples**
- Rainforest (Cross River): high rainfall, tall trees, rich biodiversity
- Savanna (Middle Belt): grasses with scattered trees, seasonal fires
- Mangroves (Niger Delta): salt-tolerant plants, nurseries for fish

**Abiotic Factors**
Light, temperature, water, soil type, salinity influence species distribution.


### 3.2: Food Chains, Food Webs, and Energy Flow

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Trophic Levels**
- Producers (plants, algae)
- Primary consumers (herbivores)
- Secondary consumers (carnivores)
- Tertiary consumers (top predators)
- Decomposers (fungi, bacteria) recycle nutrients

**Food Chain Example (Savanna)**
Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake → Hawk

**Food Webs**
Interconnected food chains showing multiple feeding links; more stable than single chains.

**Energy Pyramid**
- Only ~10% of energy transfers to next trophic level; rest lost as heat
- Explains why top predators are few

**Nigerian Context**: Overfishing in Lagos lagoons disrupts food webs; sustainable limits protect fish stocks.


### 3.3: Photosynthesis and Respiration

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Photosynthesis Equation**
6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2 (in presence of light and chlorophyll)

**Steps (Simplified)**
- Light-dependent reactions in thylakoids produce ATP and oxygen
- Light-independent (Calvin cycle) in stroma fixes CO2 into glucose

**Respiration Equation (Aerobic)**
C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy (ATP)

**Relationship**
- Photosynthesis stores energy; respiration releases energy for cells
- In plants, both occur; in animals, only respiration

**Nigerian Context**: Photosynthesis drives crop yields in rice fields of Kebbi; respiration rate affects post-harvest storage of fruits in Lagos markets.


### 3.4: Nutrient Cycles and Conservation

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**Water Cycle**: evaporation → condensation → precipitation → runoff/infiltration.
**Carbon Cycle**: photosynthesis removes CO2; respiration and combustion return CO2.
**Nitrogen Cycle**: fixation by bacteria/lightning → nitrification → assimilation → ammonification → denitrification.

**Human Impact**
- Deforestation reduces carbon storage and biodiversity
- Oil spills in Niger Delta damage mangroves and fisheries
- Fertilizer overuse causes eutrophication

**Conservation Practices**
- Reforestation and mangrove restoration
- Protected areas (Yankari, Gashaka Gumti)
- Sustainable farming: crop rotation, reduced chemical use

**Nigerian Context**: Community forestry in Cross River conserves rainforests; organic farming initiatives in Abuja reduce runoff into rivers.


## Worked Examples


### Example 3.1: Tracing Energy in a Food Web

**Context**: A simplified Niger Delta food web includes phytoplankton, shrimps, small fish, and catfish.

**Problem**: If energy at phytoplankton level is 10,000 kJ, estimate energy at catfish (tertiary consumer) assuming 10% transfer each step.

**Solution**:
```
Phytoplankton 10,000 kJ → shrimps ~1,000 kJ → small fish ~100 kJ → catfish ~10 kJ. Energy decreases sharply up the pyramid.
```

**Skills Tested**: Energy pyramid calculation, Trophic level understanding, Numerical reasoning


### Example 3.2: Balancing Photosynthesis Equation

**Context**: Students must write a balanced photosynthesis equation for practical notes.

**Problem**: Provide the balanced equation and identify reactants/products.

**Solution**:
```
Balanced: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2 (light, chlorophyll). Reactants: carbon dioxide, water. Products: glucose, oxygen.
```

**Skills Tested**: Equation balancing, Process identification, Photosynthesis knowledge


### Example 3.3: Nitrogen Cycle Application

**Context**: A farmer in Kano applies nitrogen fertilizer to maize fields.

**Problem**: Which part of the nitrogen cycle does fertilizer bypass and what is a potential consequence?

**Solution**:
```
Industrial fertilizer adds nitrates directly, bypassing natural fixation. Excess can leach into water, causing eutrophication and fish kills downstream.
```

**Skills Tested**: Cycle interpretation, Human impact analysis, Agricultural context


## Practice Problems


### Basic Level


**3.1.B**: Define ecosystem.

> **Answer**: A community of living organisms interacting with abiotic factors in an area.

> **Explanation**: Ecosystems include both biotic and abiotic components.

### Core Level


**3.4.C**: Explain why energy decreases at higher trophic levels.
