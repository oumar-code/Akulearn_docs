## Content


### 1.1: Cell Structure Overview

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**Cells as the Basic Unit of Life**

All living organisms are made of cells. Unicellular organisms (e.g., bacteria) consist of one cell, while multicellular organisms (e.g., humans, maize) have many specialized cells.

**Common Features of Cells**
- Cell membrane: selectively permeable boundary controlling entry/exit of substances
- Cytoplasm: semi-fluid medium containing organelles and dissolved substances
- Genetic material: DNA (in nucleus or nucleoid) that controls cell activities

**Plant vs Animal Cells (High-Level)**
- Plant cells: have cell wall, chloroplasts, large central vacuole
- Animal cells: no cell wall, no chloroplasts, small or temporary vacuoles

**Nigerian Context**: In Lagos teaching hospitals, understanding cell structure helps medical lab scientists interpret blood smears and tissue biopsies. In agriculture across Kaduna and Benue, plant cell knowledge supports crop improvement.


### 1.2: Organelles and Their Functions

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Key Organelles**

- Nucleus: houses DNA; controls cell activities; contains nucleolus for ribosome assembly
- Mitochondria: site of aerobic respiration; produce ATP energy
- Ribosomes: protein synthesis; free in cytoplasm or on rough ER
- Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER): transports proteins; studded with ribosomes
- Smooth ER: lipid synthesis and detoxification
- Golgi apparatus: modifies, packages, and ships proteins/lipids
- Lysosomes: contain digestive enzymes; break down waste (mainly in animal cells)
- Chloroplasts: photosynthesis in plant cells; contain chlorophyll
- Vacuole: storage and turgor pressure; large central vacuole in plant cells
- Cell wall: cellulose support layer in plants; absent in animals
- Cell membrane: phospholipid bilayer with proteins; controls transport

**Organelle Interactions**
Proteins made in ribosomes → processed in RER → packaged in Golgi → sent to membrane or organelles. Mitochondria provide ATP for these processes.

**Nigerian Context**: Food scientists in Ibadan analyze plant cell walls to improve cassava processing. Pharmacologists study lysosomes and detoxification pathways for drug development in malaria treatment.


### 1.3: Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**Prokaryotes (e.g., bacteria)**
- No true nucleus; DNA in nucleoid region
- Lack membrane-bound organelles
- Smaller size (1-10 µm)
- Reproduce mainly by binary fission

**Eukaryotes (plants, animals, fungi, protists)**
- True nucleus with nuclear envelope
- Membrane-bound organelles present
- Larger size (10-100 µm)
- Reproduce via mitosis/meiosis

**Comparative Table**
| Feature | Prokaryote | Eukaryote |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Nucleus | Absent | Present |
| Organelles | Not membrane-bound | Membrane-bound |
| Size | 1-10 µm | 10-100 µm |
| DNA form | Circular | Linear (chromosomes) |
| Division | Binary fission | Mitosis/meiosis |

**Nigerian Context**: Understanding bacteria (prokaryotes) guides antibiotic choices in Nigerian clinics. Knowledge of eukaryotic cell division supports cancer screening programs in teaching hospitals.


### 1.4: Cell Division Basics

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Mitosis (Growth and Repair)**
- Prophase: chromosomes condense; spindle forms
- Metaphase: chromosomes align at equator
- Anaphase: sister chromatids separate
- Telophase: nuclei reform; cytokinesis divides cytoplasm
- Outcome: two identical diploid daughter cells

**Meiosis (Gamete Formation)**
- Two divisions: Meiosis I (reduction), Meiosis II (separation)
- Crossing over in Prophase I creates genetic variation
- Outcome: four non-identical haploid cells

**Significance**
- Mitosis: healing of wounds in Nigerian clinics; growth in adolescents
- Meiosis: formation of sperm and eggs; important in livestock and crop breeding

**Microscopy Notes**
- Light microscope can show cell walls, nuclei, chloroplasts
- Staining improves visibility of chromosomes during mitosis


## Worked Examples


### Example 1.1: Identifying Organelles in Onion Epidermis

**Context**: A student prepares an onion peel slide to view under a light microscope.

**Problem**: Which organelles are visible and what are their functions?

**Solution**:
```
Under light microscope at 400x: cell wall (rigid outline), cell membrane (just inside wall), cytoplasm (fills cell), nucleus (dark stained spot). Chloroplasts are absent in onion bulb epidermis because bulbs are storage organs underground. Functions: wall gives shape; membrane controls transport; cytoplasm hosts reactions; nucleus controls activities.
```

**Skills Tested**: Microscopy observation, Organelle identification, Plant cell structure


### Example 1.2: Prokaryote vs Eukaryote Diagnosis

**Context**: A clinic in Abuja cultures two microbes: one shows nuclei under microscope, the other does not.

**Problem**: Classify each microbe and justify the classification.

**Solution**:
```
Microbe with visible nuclei and membrane-bound organelles is eukaryotic (likely yeast or protozoan). Microbe without nucleus but with cell wall and small size is prokaryotic (likely bacteria). Presence of nuclei is key differentiator.
```

**Skills Tested**: Cell classification, Diagnostic reasoning, Microscope interpretation


### Example 1.3: Mitosis Stage Identification

**Context**: A biology practical shows cells with chromosomes lined at the equator.

**Problem**: Which mitosis stage is this and what follows?

**Solution**:
```
Stage: Metaphase (chromosomes at equatorial plate). Next: Anaphase where sister chromatids separate to opposite poles, followed by Telophase and cytokinesis producing two identical cells.
```

**Skills Tested**: Mitosis stages, Sequence of events, Practical microscopy


## Practice Problems


### Basic Level


**1.1.B**: State two features common to all cells.

> **Answer**: Cell membrane and cytoplasm (with genetic material).

> **Explanation**: All cells have a membrane boundary and cytoplasm containing DNA/RNA.


**1.2.B**: Name the organelle responsible for energy production.

> **Answer**: Mitochondrion.

> **Explanation**: Mitochondria carry out aerobic respiration to produce ATP.


**1.3.B**: Which organelle packages proteins for secretion?

> **Answer**: Golgi apparatus.

> **Explanation**: Golgi modifies and packages proteins into vesicles.


### Core Level


**1.4.C**: Give two structural differences between plant and animal cells.

> **Answer**: Plant cells have cell walls and chloroplasts; animal cells do not. Plant cells have large central vacuoles; animal vacuoles are small or temporary.

> **Explanation**: Cell wall and chloroplast presence are key distinctions.


**1.5.C**: Why are ribosomes found on rough ER?

> **Answer**: To synthesize proteins that will be transported or secreted.

> **Explanation**: Ribosomes on RER feed proteins directly into ER lumen for processing.


**1.6.C**: Differentiate binary fission from mitosis in one sentence.

> **Answer**: Binary fission is simple cell division in prokaryotes without spindle formation; mitosis is complex division in eukaryotes with spindle and defined stages.

> **Explanation**: Presence of nucleus and spindle separates eukaryotic mitosis from prokaryotic fission.


**1.7.C**: List the stages of mitosis in order.

> **Answer**: Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase (followed by cytokinesis).

> **Explanation**: These four stages ensure equal chromosome separation.


### Challenge Level


**1.8.CH**: Explain how defects in lysosomes can affect human health.

> **Answer**: Faulty lysosomal enzymes lead to accumulation of waste materials, causing disorders like storage diseases and impaired immunity.

> **Explanation**: Lysosomes clear cellular waste; defects disrupt cell function and can cause disease.


**1.9.CH**: Predict the effect of removing the central vacuole from a plant cell.

> **Answer**: Loss of turgor pressure, cell wilting, reduced storage, and impaired growth.

> **Explanation**: Central vacuole maintains water balance and stores metabolites; without it, support is lost.


**1.10.CH**: How does crossing over in meiosis differ from events in mitosis?

> **Answer**: Crossing over exchanges genetic material between homologous chromosomes in Prophase I of meiosis, creating variation; mitosis does not include crossing over.

> **Explanation**: Genetic recombination is unique to meiosis and drives variation in offspring.
