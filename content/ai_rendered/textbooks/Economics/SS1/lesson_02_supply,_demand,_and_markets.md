## Content


### 2.1: Demand and Supply Basics

*Duration: 20 minutes*

**Demand**: quantity consumers are willing and able to buy at different prices (ceteris paribus). **Law of demand**: inverse relation between price and quantity demanded. Demand curve slopes downward.

**Determinants of demand**: income, tastes, price of related goods (substitutes/complements), expectations, population.

**Supply**: quantity producers are willing and able to sell at different prices. **Law of supply**: direct relation between price and quantity supplied. Supply curve slopes upward.

**Determinants of supply**: production cost, technology, taxes/subsidies, price expectations, number of sellers.

**Nigerian context**: Demand for rice rises during festive periods; supply of tomatoes falls in rainy season, raising prices.


### 2.2: Market Equilibrium and Price Determination

*Duration: 22 minutes*

Equilibrium occurs where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied (Qd = Qs). At equilibrium price (Pe), there is no surplus or shortage.

**Surplus**: price above Pe, Qs > Qd → downward pressure on price. **Shortage**: price below Pe, Qd > Qs → upward pressure on price.

Shifts vs movements: price change → movement along curve; determinant change → shift of curve.

**Example**: Government fertilizer subsidy shifts supply of maize right, lowering price and raising quantity.


### 2.3: Elasticity of Demand and Supply

*Duration: 25 minutes*

**Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)** = % change Qd / % change P.
- |PED| > 1: elastic; |PED| < 1: inelastic; |PED| = 1: unitary.
- Determinants: availability of substitutes, necessity vs luxury, time horizon, budget share.

**Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)** = % change Qs / % change P.
- Determinants: time to respond, spare capacity, storage ability.

**Revenue and PED**: If demand is elastic, price increase lowers revenue; if inelastic, price increase raises revenue (ceteris paribus).

**Nigerian examples**: Petrol demand is relatively inelastic short run; luxury phones elastic; agricultural supply in short run inelastic due to growing season.


### 2.4: Consumer and Producer Surplus

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Consumer surplus**: difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. Area under demand and above price up to quantity bought.

**Producer surplus**: difference between price received and minimum price producers are willing to accept. Area above supply and below price up to quantity sold.

**Total surplus** = consumer surplus + producer surplus; maximized at competitive equilibrium.

**Nigerian market example**: In Balogun market, if competition is strong, prices close to equilibrium maximize total surplus. Price controls (ceilings/floors) can create shortages or surpluses, reducing total surplus.


## Worked Examples


### Example 2.1: Finding Equilibrium

**Context**: Demand: Qd = 100 - 2P. Supply: Qs = 20 + 3P.

**Problem**: Find equilibrium price and quantity.

**Solution**:
```
Set Qd = Qs: 100 - 2P = 20 + 3P → 80 = 5P → P = 16. Q = 100 - 2(16) = 68. Equilibrium: Pe = 16, Qe = 68 units.
```

**Skills Tested**: Algebra, Equilibrium calculation


### Example 2.2: Elasticity Calculation

**Context**: Price of data bundle rises from N1000 to N1200; quantity demanded falls from 5000GB to 4400GB.

**Problem**: Calculate PED using midpoint formula.

**Solution**:
```
%ΔQ = (4400-5000)/((4400+5000)/2) = -600/4700 ≈ -0.128. %ΔP = (1200-1000)/((1200+1000)/2) = 200/1100 ≈ 0.182. PED = -0.128 / 0.182 ≈ -0.70 (inelastic).
```

**Skills Tested**: Midpoint elasticity, Interpretation


### Example 2.3: Effect of Subsidy on Supply

**Context**: A N50 per unit fertilizer subsidy reduces cost for farmers.

**Problem**: Describe supply shift and price/quantity effects.

**Solution**:
```
Supply shifts right (downward by subsidy amount). New equilibrium price falls, quantity rises. Farmers receive market price plus subsidy; consumers pay lower price; total surplus rises but has government cost.
```

**Skills Tested**: Policy impact, Supply shift reasoning


## Practice Problems


### Basic Level


**2.1.B**: State the law of demand.

> **Answer**: As price rises, quantity demanded falls (ceteris paribus).

> **Explanation**: Inverse price-quantity relation.


**2.2.B**: State the law of supply.

> **Answer**: As price rises, quantity supplied rises (ceteris paribus).

> **Explanation**: Direct price-quantity relation.


**2.3.B**: Name two determinants of demand.

> **Answer**: Income, tastes, prices of related goods, expectations, population (any two).

> **Explanation**: Shift factors.


### Core Level


**2.4.C**: Differentiate movement along demand vs shift in demand.

> **Answer**: Movement: caused by price change; Shift: caused by non-price determinants (income, tastes, etc.).

> **Explanation**: Key curve behavior.


**2.5.C**: If price is below equilibrium, what occurs?

> **Answer**: Shortage; Qd > Qs; price rises toward equilibrium.

> **Explanation**: Excess demand drives price up.


**2.6.C**: Give one Nigerian example of inelastic demand.

> **Answer**: Petrol (short run), electricity units, basic food staples (e.g., garri) short run.

> **Explanation**: Few substitutes, necessity.


**2.7.C**: If PED = -1.5 and price increases, what happens to total revenue?

> **Answer**: Demand is elastic; total revenue falls.

> **Explanation**: Price up reduces revenue when elastic.


### Challenge Level


**2.8.CH**: Compute PES when price rises 5% and quantity supplied rises 2%.

> **Answer**: PES = 2%/5% = 0.4 (inelastic supply).

> **Explanation**: Elasticity ratio.


**2.9.CH**: Explain how a price ceiling below Pe affects consumer and producer surplus.

> **Answer**: Creates shortage; some consumers gain lower price but others cannot buy; producer surplus falls; total surplus falls; deadweight loss appears.

> **Explanation**: Ceiling reduces total surplus.


**2.10.CH**: Draw and label consumer and producer surplus at equilibrium.

> **Answer**: Consumer surplus: area under demand and above Pe up to Qe; producer surplus: area above supply and below Pe up to Qe.

> **Explanation**: Graphical surplus identification.


## Glossary


**Demand**: Quantity consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices.

- *Example*: Demand for rice at N500/kg.


**Supply**: Quantity producers are willing and able to sell at various prices.

- *Example*: Supply of yams from Benue farmers.


**Equilibrium price**: Price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.

- *Example*: Market-clearing price in a Lagos market.


**Elasticity**: Responsiveness of quantity to a change in another variable (usually price).

- *Example*: PED of petrol ~ inelastic short run.


**Substitute**: Good that can replace another.

- *Example*: Bread and yam; butter and margarine.


**Complement**: Good used with another.

- *Example*: Phones and data bundles.


**Consumer surplus**: Benefit buyers get above what they pay.

- *Example*: Paying N500 for item valued at N800.


**Producer surplus**: Benefit sellers get above minimum they accept.
