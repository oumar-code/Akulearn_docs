## Content


### 3.1: Structure of the Nigerian Economy

*Duration: 22 minutes*

Economy has three broad sectors: **Primary** (agriculture, mining), **Secondary** (manufacturing, refining), **Tertiary** (services: banking, ICT, transport). Nigeria historically relies on oil (primary) but services now large share of GDP. Manufacturing seeks growth via AfCFTA and local production.

**GDP composition** (illustrative): Agriculture ~20-25%, Industry ~20-25%, Services ~50%+. Employment higher in agriculture; revenue heavily oil-dependent. Diversification is key.


### 3.2: Money, Banking, and Monetary Policy

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Functions of money**: medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, standard of deferred payment.

**Banking system**: commercial banks (deposits, loans, payments), microfinance banks (SMEs, low-income clients), development finance institutions.

**Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)** roles: issue currency, banker to government, lender of last resort, regulate banks, conduct monetary policy (set MPR), manage FX reserves, maintain price stability.

**Monetary policy tools**: Monetary Policy Rate (interest rate), Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), Open Market Operations (OMO), moral suasion, liquidity ratio. Effects: influence credit, inflation, exchange rate.


### 3.3: Government Spending, Taxation, and Fiscal Policy

*Duration: 22 minutes*

**Fiscal policy** uses government spending and taxation to influence economy.

**Revenues**: crude oil earnings, VAT, company income tax, customs duties, personal income tax (states). **Expenditures**: capital (infrastructure), recurrent (salaries, overhead), debt service.

**Budget deficits** financed by borrowing (domestic T-bills/bonds, external loans). Deficits can stimulate output short-run but raise debt and inflation risks.

**Nigerian context**: Fuel subsidy reforms affect budget; FIRS improves tax collection; infrastructure spending (roads, power) aims to spur growth.


### 3.4: Economic Development and Growth

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Economic growth**: increase in real GDP. **Development**: broader improvement in living standards (health, education, equality, environment).

**Indicators**: GDP per capita, unemployment rate, inflation, poverty rate, literacy, life expectancy, HDI, Gini coefficient.

**Challenges**: unemployment/underemployment, inflation, infrastructure gaps (power, roads), overreliance on oil, FX volatility, insecurity, governance issues.

**Policies for growth**: diversify exports (agro-processing, tech), improve power supply, invest in education/skills, strengthen institutions, support SMEs, stable macro policy.


## Worked Examples


### Example 3.1: Classifying Sectors

**Context**: A fintech startup offers mobile payments; a cement factory produces building materials; cocoa farming exports beans.

**Problem**: Assign each to primary, secondary, or tertiary sector.

**Solution**:
```
Fintech (mobile payments) = Tertiary (services). Cement factory = Secondary (manufacturing). Cocoa farming = Primary (agriculture).
```

**Skills Tested**: Sector classification, Understanding structure


### Example 3.2: Impact of Monetary Policy Rate Increase

**Context**: CBN raises MPR by 100 basis points (1%).

**Problem**: Predict short-run effects on borrowing, inflation, and exchange rate.

**Solution**:
```
Higher MPR raises lending rates → borrowing cost up → credit growth slows → inflationary pressure may ease. Higher rates can attract capital, supporting naira. Growth may slow if credit-sensitive sectors reduce investment.
```

**Skills Tested**: Policy transmission, Macroeconomic reasoning


### Example 3.3: Fiscal Policy Trade-off

**Context**: Government considers N200bn capital spending on power vs. same amount on wage increases.

**Problem**: What are potential growth and budget effects?

**Solution**:
```
Capital spending on power can raise productivity and long-term growth; wage increase boosts consumption short-run but may raise recurrent spending and deficits. Opportunity cost: choosing wages may delay infrastructure gains; choosing power may limit short-run consumption benefits.
```

**Skills Tested**: Fiscal choices, Opportunity cost in policy


## Practice Problems


### Basic Level


**3.1.B**: Name the three main sectors of an economy.

> **Answer**: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary.

> **Explanation**: Standard sector breakdown.


**3.2.B**: List two functions of money.

> **Answer**: Medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, standard of deferred payment (any two).

> **Explanation**: Core money roles.


**3.3.B**: What is fiscal policy?

> **Answer**: Use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy.

> **Explanation**: Definition.


### Core Level


**3.4.C**: Give one revenue source and one major expenditure item in Nigeria's budget.

> **Answer**: Revenue: crude oil earnings or VAT/CIT; Expenditure: infrastructure or salaries/debt service.

> **Explanation**: Budget components.


**3.5.C**: State one tool of monetary policy.

> **Answer**: Monetary Policy Rate (interest rate), CRR, OMO, liquidity ratio, moral suasion (any one).

> **Explanation**: Policy instruments.


**3.6.C**: If inflation is high, what stance might CBN take?

> **Answer**: Tighten policy: raise MPR/CRR, sell securities via OMO to reduce money supply.

> **Explanation**: Anti-inflation tightening.


**3.7.C**: Name two challenges facing Nigerian economic development.

> **Answer**: Power shortages, unemployment, infrastructure gap, overreliance on oil, insecurity, FX volatility (any two).

> **Explanation**: Common constraints.


### Challenge Level


**3.8.CH**: Explain how a fall in oil prices can affect Nigeria's fiscal and external balances.

> **Answer**: Lower oil revenue widens fiscal deficit; may weaken naira due to lower FX inflows; can cut public spending or increase borrowing; current account may deteriorate.

> **Explanation**: Oil dependence channels.


**3.9.CH**: Suggest two policies to diversify Nigeria's economy and their expected effects.

> **Answer**: Invest in agro-processing/SMEs/tech to raise non-oil exports; improve power and infrastructure to lower costs; expected effects: broader revenue base, jobs, more stable FX.

> **Explanation**: Diversification rationale.


**3.10.CH**: Interpret a rise in unemployment alongside high inflation (stagflation risk). What mix of policies could address this?

> **Answer**: Stagflation suggests supply constraints. Policies: structural fixes (power, logistics), targeted support for production, cautious monetary tightening to tame inflation, coordinated fiscal measures without overheating demand.

> **Explanation**: Balanced macro response.
