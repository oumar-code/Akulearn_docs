## Content


### 1.1: What Is Economics? Scarcity, Wants, and Needs

*Duration: 20 minutes*

Economics studies how people and societies allocate scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. **Scarcity** means resources are limited relative to wants. **Wants** are desires; **needs** are essential for survival (food, shelter, clothing). Because of scarcity, choices must be made, leading to **opportunity cost** (next best alternative forgone).

**Nigerian context**: Petrol queues show scarcity; power outages reflect limited electricity supply; farmland availability in Benue vs urban land scarcity in Lagos.


### 1.2: Production and Factors of Production

*Duration: 22 minutes*

Production combines resources to create goods and services. **Factors of production**: (1) **Land** (all natural resources; reward = rent), (2) **Labour** (human effort; reward = wage), (3) **Capital** (machinery, tools, buildings; reward = interest), (4) **Enterprise/Entrepreneurship** (risk-taking, coordination; reward = profit).

**Nigerian context**: Land (oil in Niger Delta, cocoa in Ondo), Labour (teachers, farmers), Capital (refineries, tractors), Enterprise (tech startups in Lagos, SMEs in Aba).


### 1.3: Opportunity Cost and Production Possibility Frontier

*Duration: 23 minutes*

**Opportunity cost** is the benefit of the next best alternative given up when a choice is made.

**PPF** shows maximum output combinations of two goods with current resources and technology. Points on curve = efficient, inside = inefficient, outside = unattainable (current resources). Opportunity cost rises as more of one good is produced (concave PPF).

**Nigerian example**: Using land for cassava vs maize; using budget for roads vs health. Choosing more refineries may mean fewer funds for education.


### 1.4: Economic Systems and Nigeria's Mixed Economy

*Duration: 25 minutes*

**Traditional economy**: customs, subsistence farming; **Command**: government controls resources (planned); **Market**: private ownership, price mechanism allocates resources; **Mixed**: combines market forces with government intervention.

Nigeria operates a **mixed economy**: private sector (banks, manufacturing, services) plus government role (CBN regulation, subsidies, infrastructure, SOEs like NNPC Ltd).

Advantages/Disadvantages: Markets encourage efficiency and innovation; government corrects market failures (public goods, externalities). Too much control can reduce efficiency; too little can create inequality.


## Worked Examples


### Example 1.1: Identifying Opportunity Cost

**Context**: A school has funds to buy either 10 computers or 500 textbooks.

**Problem**: If the principal chooses computers, what is the opportunity cost?

**Solution**:
```
Opportunity cost = the next best alternative forgone: 500 textbooks. The value (benefit) students would have gained from textbooks is sacrificed.
```

**Skills Tested**: Opportunity cost reasoning, Decision trade-offs


### Example 1.2: Factor of Production Classification

**Context**: A farmer in Kaduna buys a tractor to expand maize production.

**Problem**: Classify land, labour, capital, enterprise; identify rewards.

**Solution**:
```
Land: farmland (rent). Labour: farmer and hired workers (wages). Capital: tractor (interest/return). Enterprise: farmer's coordination and risk (profit).
```

**Skills Tested**: Factor identification, Applying rewards


### Example 1.3: Reading a PPF

**Context**: PPF between yam (Y) and rice (R). Point A (10Y, 0R), B (8Y, 4R), C (5Y, 7R), D (0Y, 10R).

**Problem**: What is the opportunity cost of moving from B to C?

**Solution**:
```
From B (8Y,4R) to C (5Y,7R): gain +3R, give up -3Y. Opportunity cost of 3 additional rice units is 3 yam units.
```

**Skills Tested**: PPF interpretation, Opportunity cost


## Practice Problems


### Basic Level


**1.1.B**: Define scarcity.

> **Answer**: Limited resources relative to unlimited wants.

> **Explanation**: Scarcity forces choice and opportunity cost.


**1.2.B**: List the four factors of production.

> **Answer**: Land, labour, capital, enterprise (entrepreneurship).

> **Explanation**: Core resource categories.


**1.3.B**: What is opportunity cost?

> **Answer**: The value of the next best alternative forgone.

> **Explanation**: Cost measured in foregone benefit.


### Core Level


**1.4.C**: Give one Nigerian example of land and one of capital.

> **Answer**: Land: crude oil reserves; Capital: refinery equipment (or tractors, factory machines).

> **Explanation**: Land = natural; capital = man-made tools.


**1.5.C**: State the reward for each factor of production.

> **Answer**: Land: rent; Labour: wage/salary; Capital: interest; Enterprise: profit.

> **Explanation**: Standard factor payments.


**1.6.C**: Name two features of a mixed economy.

> **Answer**: Private ownership with government regulation; coexistence of market pricing and public sector provision; government corrects market failures.

> **Explanation**: Mixed = market + state.


**1.7.C**: If Nigeria increases spending on health, what could be an opportunity cost?

> **Answer**: Reduced funds for roads/education/defence (next best alternative forgone).

> **Explanation**: Public budget trade-offs.


### Challenge Level


**1.8.CH**: Explain why a point inside the PPF is inefficient.

> **Answer**: Resources are underutilized (unemployment, idle capital); economy could produce more of both goods without extra resources.

> **Explanation**: Inside curve means inefficiency.


**1.9.CH**: Give one advantage and one disadvantage of command economies.

> **Answer**: Advantage: can mobilize resources quickly for priorities; Disadvantage: low efficiency, weak innovation due to lack of price signals.

> **Explanation**: Planning vs incentives trade-off.


**1.10.CH**: A state allocates land to build a solar farm instead of more housing. Identify opportunity cost and factor payments involved.

> **Answer**: Opportunity cost: housing benefits forgone. Factor payments: rent for land, wages for labour, interest/returns on capital equipment, profit for developers/entrepreneurs.

> **Explanation**: Links choice with factors and rewards.
