Demand curve slopes downward.\n\n**Determinants of demand**: income, tastes, price of related goods (substitutes/complements), expectations, population.\n\n**Supply**: quantity producers are willing and able to sell at different prices. **Law of supply**: direct relation between price and quantity supplied. Supply curve slopes upward.\n\n**Determinants of supply**: production cost, technology, taxes/subsidies, price expectations, number of sellers.\n\n**Nigerian context**: Demand for rice rises during festive periods; supply of tomatoes falls in rainy season, raising prices."

      "duration_minutes": 22,
      "content": "Equilibrium occurs where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied (Qd = Qs). At equilibrium price (Pe), there is no surplus or shortage.\n\n**Surplus**: price above Pe, Qs > Qd → downward pressure on price. **Shortage**: price below Pe, Qd > Qs → upward pressure on price.\n\nShifts vs movements: price change → movement along curve; determinant change → shift of curve.\n\n**Example**: Government fertilizer subsidy shifts supply of maize right, lowering price and raising quantity."

      "duration_minutes": 23,
      "content": "**Consumer surplus**: difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. Area under demand and above price up to quantity bought.\n\n**Producer surplus**: difference between price received and minimum price producers are willing to accept. Area above supply and below price up to quantity sold.\n\n**Total surplus** = consumer surplus + producer surplus; maximized at competitive equilibrium.\n\n**Nigerian market example**: In Balogun market, if competition is strong, prices close to equilibrium maximize total surplus. Price controls (ceilings/floors) can create shortages or surpluses, reducing total surplus."
