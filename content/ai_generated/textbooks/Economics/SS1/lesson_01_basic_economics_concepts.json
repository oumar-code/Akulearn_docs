      "duration_minutes": 20,
      "content": "Economics studies how people and societies allocate scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. **Scarcity** means resources are limited relative to wants. **Wants** are desires; **needs** are essential for survival (food, shelter, clothing). Because of scarcity, choices must be made, leading to **opportunity cost** (next best alternative forgone).\n\n**Nigerian context**: Petrol queues show scarcity; power outages reflect limited electricity supply; farmland availability in Benue vs urban land scarcity in Lagos."

      "title": "Production and Factors of Production",
      "duration_minutes": 22,
      "content": "Production combines resources to create goods and services. **Factors of production**: (1) **Land** (all natural resources; reward = rent), (2) **Labour** (human effort; reward = wage), (3) **Capital** (machinery, tools, buildings; reward = interest), (4) **Enterprise/Entrepreneurship** (risk-taking, coordination; reward = profit).\n\n**Nigerian context**: Land (oil in Niger Delta, cocoa in Ondo), Labour (teachers, farmers), Capital (refineries, tractors), Enterprise (tech startups in Lagos, SMEs in Aba)."

      "title": "Opportunity Cost and Production Possibility Frontier",
      "duration_minutes": 23,
      "content": "**Opportunity cost** is the benefit of the next best alternative given up when a choice is made.\n\n**PPF** shows maximum output combinations of two goods with current resources and technology. Points on curve = efficient, inside = inefficient, outside = unattainable (current resources). Opportunity cost rises as more of one good is produced (concave PPF).\n\n**Nigerian example**: Using land for cassava vs maize; using budget for roads vs health. Choosing more refineries may mean fewer funds for education."

      "title": "Economic Systems and Nigeria's Mixed Economy",
      "duration_minutes": 25,
      "content": "**Traditional economy**: customs, subsistence farming; **Command**: government controls resources (planned); **Market**: private ownership, price mechanism allocates resources; **Mixed**: combines market forces with government intervention.\n\nNigeria operates a **mixed economy**: private sector (banks, manufacturing, services) plus government role (CBN regulation, subsidies, infrastructure, SOEs like NNPC Ltd).\n\nAdvantages/Disadvantages: Markets encourage efficiency and innovation; government corrects market failures (public goods, externalities). Too much control can reduce efficiency; too little can create inequality."
