      "content": "Economy has three broad sectors: **Primary** (agriculture, mining), **Secondary** (manufacturing, refining), **Tertiary** (services: banking, ICT, transport). Nigeria historically relies on oil (primary) but services now large share of GDP. Manufacturing seeks growth via AfCFTA and local production.\n\n**GDP composition** (illustrative): Agriculture ~20-25%, Industry ~20-25%, Services ~50%+. Employment higher in agriculture; revenue heavily oil-dependent. Diversification is key."

Effects: influence credit, inflation, exchange rate."

      "duration_minutes": 22,
      "content": "**Fiscal policy** uses government spending and taxation to influence economy.\n\n**Revenues**: crude oil earnings, VAT, company income tax, customs duties, personal income tax (states). **Expenditures**: capital (infrastructure), recurrent (salaries, overhead), debt service.\n\n**Budget deficits** financed by borrowing (domestic T-bills/bonds, external loans). Deficits can stimulate output short-run but raise debt and inflation risks.\n\n**Nigerian context**: Fuel subsidy reforms affect budget; FIRS improves tax collection; infrastructure spending (roads, power) aims to spur growth."
