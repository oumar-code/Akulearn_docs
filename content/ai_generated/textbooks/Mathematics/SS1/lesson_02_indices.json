      "content": "An index (or exponent) tells us how many times a number is multiplied by itself.\n\n**Definition**: If a is a number and n is a positive integer, then a^n = a × a × a × ... × a (n times)\n\nWe read a^n as \"a to the power of n\" or \"a raised to the power of n\"\n\nIn the expression a^n:\n- **a** is called the base\n- **n** is called the index (or exponent, or power)\n- **a^n** is called the power\n\n**Examples**:\n- 2³ = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 (read as \"2 to the power of 3\" or \"2 cubed\")\n- 5² = 5 × 5 = 25 (read as \"5 to the power of 2\" or \"5 squared\")\n- 10⁴ = 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 10,000\n- a⁵ = a × a × a × a × a (product of five a's)\n\n**Special Cases**:\n- Any number to the power of 1 equals itself: a¹ = a\n- Any number to the power of 0 equals 1: a⁰ = 1 (except 0⁰ is undefined)\n- The power of 2 is called \"squaring\": a² means \"the square of a\"\n- The power of 3 is called \"cubing\": a³ means \"the cube of a\"\n\n**Nigerian Application**: In banking, if you invest ₦100,000 at 5% compound interest per year, after n years you have ₦100,000 × (1.05)^n. This is why understanding indices is crucial for financial literacy in Nigeria!"

      "duration_minutes": 25,
      "content": "There are five main laws of indices that make calculations easier. These laws allow us to simplify expressions without writing out all the multiplications.\n\n**Law 1: Multiplication Rule (Same Base)**\nWhen multiplying powers with the same base, add the exponents:\n**a^m × a^n = a^(m+n)**\n\nExample:\n2³ × 2⁴ = (2 × 2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2 × 2) = 2⁷ = 128\nOr using the law: 2³ × 2⁴ = 2^(3+4) = 2⁷\n\nExample with variables:\nx² × x⁵ = x^(2+5) = x⁷\n\n**Law 2: Division Rule (Same Base)**\nWhen dividing powers with the same base, subtract the exponents:\n**a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n)**\n\nExample:\n5⁶ ÷ 5³ = 5^(6-3) = 5³ = 125\n\nExample with variables:\na⁸ ÷ a³ = a^(8-3) = a⁵\n\n**Law 3: Power of a Power**\nWhen raising a power to another power, multiply the exponents:\n**(a^m)^n = a^(mn)**\n\nExample:\n(2³)² = 2³ × 2³ = 2⁶ = 64\nOr using the law: (2³)² = 2^(3×2) = 2⁶\n\nExample with variables:\n(x²)⁵ = x^(2×5) = x¹⁰\n\n**Law 4: Power of a Product**\nWhen raising a product to a power, apply the power to each factor:\n**(ab)^n = a^n × b^n**\n\nExample:\n(2 × 3)² = 2² × 3² = 4 × 9 = 36\nOr directly: (6)² = 36 ✓\n\nExample with variables:\n(2xy)³ = 2³ × x³ × y³ = 8x³y³\n\n**Law 5: Power of a Quotient**\nWhen raising a quotient to a power, apply the power to both numerator and denominator:\n**(a/b)^n = a^n / b^n** (where b ≠ 0)\n\nExample:\n(2/3)² = 2² / 3² = 4/9\n\nExample with variables:\n(x/y)³ = x³ / y³"

      "title": "Negative and Fractional Indices",
      "duration_minutes": 25,
      "content": "**Negative Indices**\n\nA negative index means we take the reciprocal (flip the fraction) of the positive power:\n**a^(-n) = 1 / a^n** (where a ≠ 0)\n\nExamples:\n- 2⁻³ = 1/2³ = 1/8 = 0.125\n- 5⁻² = 1/5² = 1/25 = 0.04\n- x⁻⁴ = 1/x⁴\n\nWhy? Because of the division rule: a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n)\nIf m < n, we get negative exponents:\n2² ÷ 2⁵ = 2^(2-5) = 2⁻³ = 1/2³ ✓\n\n**Fractional Indices**\n\nA fractional index means we take a root:\n**a^(1/n) = ⁿ√a** (the nth root of a)\n\nFor example:\n- a^(1/2) = √a (square root)\n- a^(1/3) = ³√a (cube root)\n- a^(1/4) = ⁴√a (fourth root)\n- a^(1/n) = ⁿ√a (nth root)\n\nGeneral rule:\n**a^(m/n) = ⁿ√(a^m) = (ⁿ√a)^m**\n\nExamples:\n- 8^(1/3) = ³√8 = 2 (because 2³ = 8)\n- 16^(1/2) = √16 = 4\n- 27^(2/3) = (³√27)² = 3² = 9\n- 32^(2/5) = (⁵√32)² = 2² = 4 (because ⁵√32 = 2)\n\n**Nigerian Context**: In construction, calculating dimensions of cubic rooms, square floors, or scaling architectural designs often requires fractional indices. For example, if a square room has area 100 m², the side length is 100^(1/2) = 10 m."

      "content": "Scientific notation is a way of writing very large or very small numbers using powers of 10. This is essential in science and engineering.\n\n**Standard Form**: A number in scientific notation is written as:\n**a × 10^n** where 1 ≤ a < 10 and n is an integer\n\nThe number 'a' is called the mantissa or coefficient, and n is called the exponent or order of magnitude.\n\n**Large Numbers**:\n- 50,000 = 5 × 10⁴\n- 3,000,000 = 3 × 10⁶\n- 256,000,000 = 2.56 × 10⁸\n\n**Small Numbers**:\n- 0.005 = 5 × 10⁻³\n- 0.00023 = 2.3 × 10⁻⁴\n- 0.000000056 = 5.6 × 10⁻⁸\n\n**How to Convert**:\n1. Move the decimal point to get a number between 1 and 10\n2. Count how many places you moved it\n3. If you moved it LEFT, the exponent is positive\n4. If you moved it RIGHT, the exponent is negative\n\nExample: Convert 2,450,000 to scientific notation\n- Move decimal point 6 places to the left: 2.45\n- Scientific notation: 2.45 × 10⁶\n\n**Nigerian/African Examples**:\n- Nigeria's population: ~223,000,000 = 2.23 × 10⁸\n- Diameter of a bacteria: 0.000001 m = 1 × 10⁻⁶ m\n- Distance from Lagos to New York: ~6,100,000 m = 6.1 × 10⁶ m\n- Size of a virus: ~0.000000100 m = 1 × 10⁻⁷ m"
