      "content": "A number system is a method of representing numbers using symbols or digits. The most commonly used number system in daily life is the Denary (or Decimal) system, which uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, we use different number systems depending on the context. The choice of base (or radix) determines how many unique digits we need and how we interpret their positions.\n\nKey Concept: Positional Notation\nIn any number system, the position of a digit determines its value. In the denary system, the number 234 means:\n- 2 × 10² + 3 × 10¹ + 4 × 10⁰ = 200 + 30 + 4 = 234\n\nThis positional principle applies to all number systems. In any base b, a digit in position p (counting from the right, starting at 0) has a value multiplied by b^p.",
