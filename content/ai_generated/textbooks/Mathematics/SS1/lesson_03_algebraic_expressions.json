      "content": "An **algebraic expression** is a mathematical phrase that contains variables (letters), constants (numbers), and operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).\n\n**Components of Algebraic Expressions**:\n\n1. **Variables**: Letters (a, b, x, y, etc.) that represent unknown or changing quantities\n2. **Coefficients**: Numbers that multiply variables (in 3x, 3 is the coefficient)\n3. **Constants**: Numbers that stand alone (in 3x + 5, 5 is a constant)\n4. **Terms**: Parts of an expression separated by + or - signs\n5. **Like Terms**: Terms with the same variable(s) and powers (3x and 7x are like terms; 3x² and 3x are not)\n\n**Examples**:\n- 2x + 5 (two terms: 2x and 5)\n- 3a² - 4a + 7 (three terms: 3a², -4a, and 7)\n- x³y + 2xy² - 5 (three terms with variables x and y)\n\n**Types of Algebraic Expressions**:\n\n- **Monomial**: Single term (5x, 3a²b)\n- **Binomial**: Two terms (x + 3, 2a - b)\n- **Trinomial**: Three terms (x² + 3x + 2)\n- **Polynomial**: Multiple terms (4x³ + 3x² - 2x + 1)\n\n**Evaluating Algebraic Expressions**:\n\nTo find the value of an expression, substitute numbers for variables:\nExample: If x = 3, evaluate 2x + 5\n2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Traders use algebraic expressions to calculate profits. If an item costs ₦n and profit per item is ₦50, the profit from selling m items is 50m. Using algebra, they can predict earnings for different quantities."
