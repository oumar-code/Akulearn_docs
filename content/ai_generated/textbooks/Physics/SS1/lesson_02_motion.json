It is a scalar quantity (has magnitude only).\n- Always positive\n- Depends on the route taken\n- Symbol: s (sometimes used generically) or d\n\n**Displacement** is the straight-line distance and direction from start to finish. It is a vector quantity (has magnitude and direction).\n- Can be positive or negative (indicates direction)\n- Independent of the path taken\n- Symbol: s (with direction specified) or Δs\n\n**Example**: A person walks from home to market (5 km north) and back home.\n- **Distance** = 5 km + 5 km = 10 km (total path length)\n- **Displacement** = 0 km (ends at starting point)\n\n**Speed and Velocity**\n\n**Speed** is how fast an object is moving. It is a scalar quantity.\n- Always positive\n- Formula: Speed = Distance / Time\n- Unit: m/s\n\n**Velocity** is the rate of change of displacement. It is a vector quantity with direction.\n- Can be positive or negative (indicates direction)\n- Formula: Velocity = Displacement / Time\n- Unit: m/s (with direction specified, e.g., 5 m/s north)\n\n**Example**: A car travels 120 km in 2 hours heading north, then returns 120 km in 2 hours heading south.\n- **Average speed** = Total distance / Total time = 240 km / 4 h = 60 km/h\n- **Average velocity** = Total displacement / Total time = 0 km / 4 h = 0 m/s (net displacement is zero)\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Lagos bus drivers travel along Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The route distance might be 130 km, but if they go off the main road, total distance could be 150 km. However, displacement is the straight-line distance from Lagos to Ibadan, regardless of route."

It's what a speedometer reads, but includes direction.\n\nInstantaneous velocity = rate of change of displacement at that instant\n\nOn a displacement-time graph, instantaneous velocity is the slope of the tangent line at that point.\n\n**Average vs. Instantaneous**:\n- A car on an expressway might have average velocity of 80 km/h\n- At any instant, its instantaneous velocity might be 75 km/h, then 85 km/h (varying due to traffic)\n\n**On Graphs**:\n- Displacement-time graph: slope = velocity\n- Steep slope = high velocity\n- Gentle slope = low velocity\n- Horizontal line = zero velocity (object at rest)"

      "duration_minutes": 20,
      "content": "**Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity. It is a vector quantity with magnitude and direction.\n\n**Formula**:\n**a = Δv / Δt = (v_final - v_initial) / t**\n\nwhere:\n- a = acceleration (m/s²)\n- Δv = change in velocity (m/s)\n- Δt = time interval (s)\n\n**Understanding Acceleration**:\n\nAcceleration means velocity is changing. This can happen in three ways:\n1. **Speed increases** (positive acceleration): car speeding up from 0 to 100 km/h\n2. **Speed decreases** (negative acceleration/deceleration): car braking from 100 to 50 km/h\n3. **Direction changes** (always acceleration): car moving at constant speed but turning a corner\n\n**Examples**:\n\nExample 1: Positive acceleration\nA car increases velocity from 10 m/s to 25 m/s in 5 seconds\na = (25 - 10) / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 m/s²\nInterpretation: Velocity increases by 3 m/s every second\n\nExample 2: Negative acceleration (Deceleration)\nA car brakes, reducing velocity from 20 m/s to 5 m/s in 3 seconds\na = (5 - 20) / 3 = -15 / 3 = -5 m/s²\nInterpretation: Velocity decreases by 5 m/s every second (car is braking)\n\nExample 3: Zero acceleration\nA car maintains constant velocity of 15 m/s for 10 seconds\na = (15 - 15) / 10 = 0 m/s²\nInterpretation: No change in velocity (uniform motion)\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Nigerian highways have speed limits. A typical limit is 100 km/h. If a vehicle accelerates from rest at a checkpoint with a = 2 m/s², it takes 14 seconds to reach 100 km/h (28 m/s). Police at speed cameras measure acceleration to catch drivers exceeding speed limits.\n\n**Acceleration due to Gravity**\n\nAll objects falling near Earth's surface experience gravitational acceleration:\n**g ≈ 9.8 m/s²** (often rounded to 10 m/s² in calculations)\n\nThis means: Every second an object falls, its velocity increases by about 9.8 m/s"
