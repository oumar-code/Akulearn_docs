      "content": "**What is Force?**\n\nA force is a push or pull that can change the state of motion of an object. Force is a vector quantity with both magnitude and direction.\n\n**Effects of Force**:\n1. **Change velocity** (speed up, slow down, or change direction)\n2. **Change shape** (deform objects)\n3. **Start or stop motion** (overcome inertia)\n\n**Unit of Force**: Newton (N)\n- 1 Newton = 1 kg·m/s²\n- This is the SI unit of force\n\n**Mass vs. Weight**\n\n**Mass**:\n- Amount of matter in an object\n- Scalar quantity (magnitude only)\n- Constant everywhere (same on Earth, Moon, Mars, space)\n- Unit: kilograms (kg)\n- Measured with a balance scale\n\n**Weight**:\n- Gravitational force acting on an object\n- Vector quantity (has direction—always downward)\n- Varies with location (different on Earth, Moon, Mars)\n- Unit: Newtons (N)\n- Measured with a spring scale\n\n**Relationship**: W = mg\nwhere:\n- W = weight (N)\n- m = mass (kg)\n- g = gravitational field strength ≈ 9.8 m/s² (≈ 10 m/s²)\n\n**Example**:\nA student has mass 60 kg\n- On Earth: W = 60 × 10 = 600 N\n- On Moon (g ≈ 1.6 m/s²): W = 60 × 1.6 = 96 N\n- In space: W = 0 N\n\nThe student's mass remains 60 kg everywhere.\n\n**Nigerian Context**: When buying groceries in Nigeria, the shopkeeper weighs items in kilograms (mass). But the scale reading actually shows the normal force (related to weight). A 1 kg bag of rice weighs about 10 N on Earth."

      "duration_minutes": 15,
      "content": "**Newton's First Law**:\n\n\"An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced (net) force.\"\n\nThis is the **Law of Inertia**.\n\n**What is Inertia?**\n\nInertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. Objects with greater mass have greater inertia (harder to move or stop).\n\n**Key Principle**: A net force of zero means no acceleration. The object either:\n- Remains at rest, OR\n- Continues moving at constant velocity\n\n**Balanced vs. Unbalanced Forces**:\n\n**Balanced Forces**:\n- Equal and opposite forces\n- Net force = 0\n- No acceleration (object remains as is)\n- Example: A book resting on a table\n  - Weight (downward) = Normal force (upward)\n  - Net force = 0, book stays at rest\n\n**Unbalanced Forces**:\n- Forces don't cancel out\n- Net force ≠ 0\n- Acceleration occurs\n- Example: Pushing a car\n  - Applied force > Friction\n  - Net force forward, car accelerates\n\n**Real-World Examples**:\n\n1. **Seatbelts in Cars**: When a car suddenly stops, the car experiences unbalanced force (braking). Without a seatbelt, the passenger (experiencing no braking force initially) continues forward due to inertia. The seatbelt provides the force to decelerate the passenger with the car.\n\n2. **Nigerian Markets**: A trader carrying goods on their head tends to continue moving at constant speed due to inertia. When they suddenly stop, the goods want to keep moving (this is why goods can fall if stopped abruptly).\n\n3. **Spacecraft**: In the vacuum of space, with no friction, an object launched forward continues indefinitely at the same velocity without any additional force needed."

      "duration_minutes": 20,
      "content": "**Newton's Second Law**:\n\n\"The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.\"\n\n**Formula**: F_net = ma\n\nwhere:\n- F_net = net force (N)\n- m = mass (kg)\n- a = acceleration (m/s²)\n\n**Rearranged Forms**:\n- a = F_net / m (acceleration from force and mass)\n- m = F_net / a (mass from force and acceleration)\n\n**Understanding the Relationships**:\n\n1. **Directly Proportional to Force**:\n   - Double the force → double the acceleration\n   - Example: Pushing a cart twice as hard makes it accelerate twice as much\n\n2. **Inversely Proportional to Mass**:\n   - Double the mass → half the acceleration (for same force)\n   - Example: Same force applied to a heavier cart causes less acceleration\n\n3. **Combining Forces**:\nWhen multiple forces act, find the net force (vector sum):\nF_net = F₁ + F₂ + F₃ + ...\n\n**Example 1: Calculating Force**\n\nA 1000 kg car accelerates at 2 m/s². What force is needed?\nF = ma\nF = 1000 × 2 = 2000 N\n\n**Example 2: Calculating Acceleration**\n\nA 50 kg student pushes a 10 kg crate with 100 N force. Assume no friction. What is the acceleration?\na = F / m\na = 100 / 10 = 10 m/s²\n\n**Example 3: Effect of Mass (Nigerian Context)**\n\nTwo lorries: one carrying sand (5000 kg), one empty (2000 kg). Both are pushed by engines exerting 10,000 N force.\n- Loaded lorry: a = 10,000 / 5000 = 2 m/s²\n- Empty lorry: a = 10,000 / 2000 = 5 m/s²\n\nThe empty lorry accelerates faster because it has less mass.\n\n**Forces in Different Directions**:\n\nWhen forces act at angles, we must consider their components and find the net force vectorially. This typically requires resolving into components (covered in vector chapters)."

      "duration_minutes": 20,
      "content": "**Newton's Third Law**:\n\n\"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"\n\nOr more formally: \"If object A exerts a force on object B, then object B simultaneously exerts a force on object A that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\"\n\n**Key Points**:\n- Forces always come in pairs (action-reaction pairs)\n- The two forces are:\n  - Equal in magnitude\n  - Opposite in direction\n  - Acting on different objects\n  - Of the same type (both contact or both field forces)\n\n**Examples of Action-Reaction Pairs**:\n\n1. **Walking**: You push the ground backward (action). The ground pushes you forward (reaction). This forward push propels you.\n\n2. **Ball Thrown at Wall**: Ball pushes wall (action). Wall pushes ball back (reaction).\n\n3. **Rocket Launch**: Rocket expels hot gas downward (action). Gas pushes rocket upward (reaction).\n\n4. **Nigerian Context - Fishing Boat**: Fisherman pushes water backward with oar (action). Water pushes boat forward (reaction).\n\n**Friction**\n\nFriction is a contact force that opposes motion between surfaces.\n\n**Types of Friction**:\n\n1. **Static Friction** (f_s):\n   - Acts on stationary objects\n   - Prevents motion from starting\n   - Can vary from 0 to maximum value\n   - Formula: f_s ≤ μ_s × N\n   - Where μ_s = coefficient of static friction, N = normal force\n\n2. **Kinetic Friction** (f_k):\n   - Acts on moving objects\n   - Opposes the motion\n   - Constant magnitude (for given surfaces and normal force)\n   - Formula: f_k = μ_k × N\n   - Where μ_k = coefficient of kinetic friction\n   - Usually: μ_k < μ_s (easier to keep sliding than start sliding)\n\n**Factors Affecting Friction**:\n- **Nature of surfaces**: Rough surfaces have higher friction\n- **Normal force**: More contact force → more friction\n- **NOT affected by**: Surface area or speed (for kinetic friction)\n\n**Example 1: Static Friction (Nigerian Shop)**\n\nA 40 kg crate of goods sits on a shop floor. The coefficient of static friction is 0.5.\n- Normal force N = weight = 40 × 10 = 400 N\n- Max static friction = 0.5 × 400 = 200 N\n\nIf the shopkeeper pushes with 150 N, the crate doesn't move (friction adjusts to 150 N).\nIf the shopkeeper pushes with 250 N, the crate moves (applied force exceeds max static friction).\n\n**Example 2: Kinetic Friction (Vehicle on Road)**\n\nA 1000 kg car sliding on wet Lagos road with coefficient of kinetic friction 0.6.\n- Normal force = 1000 × 10 = 10,000 N\n- Kinetic friction = 0.6 × 10,000 = 6000 N\n\nThis friction force opposes the motion and causes deceleration:\na = -6000 / 1000 = -6 m/s² (negative = slowing down)\n\n**Benefits and Problems of Friction**:\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Allows walking and running\n- Enables vehicles to grip roads\n- Braking system relies on friction\n\n**Problems**:\n- Causes wear on machinery\n- Reduces efficiency of motors\n- Requires energy to overcome\n\n**Reducing Friction**:\n- Oil/lubrication in machinery\n- Smooth surfaces\n- Air cushion (hovercraft)"
