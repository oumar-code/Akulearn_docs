The number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides.\n\n**Balancing Equations**\n\nA balanced equation has equal numbers of each type of atom on both sides.\n\n**Method**:\n1. Count atoms of each element on both sides\n2. Identify atoms not balanced\n3. Add coefficients (never change subscripts)\n4. Recount to verify balance\n\n**Example 1: Combustion of Methane**\nUnbalanced: CH₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O\n\nAtom count (unbalanced):\n- C: 1 left, 1 right ✓\n- H: 4 left, 2 right ✗\n- O: 2 left, 4 right ✗\n\nAdd coefficient 2 to H₂O: CH₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O\nRecount: H: 4 left, 4 right ✓; O: 2 left, 4 right ✗\n\nAdd coefficient 2 to O₂: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O\nFinal count: All balanced ✓\n\n**Balanced**: **CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O**\n\n**Symbol Meanings**:\n- → : Single arrow (irreversible reaction)\n- ⇌ : Double arrow (reversible reaction)\n- ↑ : Gas escapes\n- ↓ : Precipitate forms\n- (s) : Solid state\n- (l) : Liquid state\n- (g) : Gaseous state\n- (aq) : Aqueous (dissolved in water)\n\n**Example 2: Ionic Equation**\n**AgNO₃(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)**\n\n**Nigerian Context**: In Lagos water treatment, reactions are written to show precipitation of impurities:\n**Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 3Ca(OH)₂ → 2Fe(OH)₃↓ + 3CaSO₄**"
