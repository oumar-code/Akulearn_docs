SOLIDS**\n\n**Particle Arrangement**:\n- Particles are tightly packed in fixed, regular patterns (crystal lattices)\n- Particles held in place by strong intermolecular forces\n- Minimal space between particles\n\n**Particle Motion**:\n- Particles vibrate in fixed positions\n- Cannot move freely from place to place\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- **Fixed shape**: Solid maintains its shape regardless of container\n- **Fixed volume**: Solid has definite volume (cannot be compressed easily)\n- **Incompressible**: Very difficult to compress because particles are already tightly packed\n- **Dense**: Higher density than liquids and gases\n\n**Examples**: Iron (Fe), salt (NaCl), diamond, ice\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Building materials like concrete and steel used in Lagos construction are solids with fixed structure.\n\n---\n\n**2. LIQUIDS**\n\n**Particle Arrangement**:\n- Particles are close together but not in fixed pattern\n- Some intermolecular forces exist, but weaker than in solids\n- Particles in random arrangement\n\n**Particle Motion**:\n- Particles can move and slide past each other\n- Have kinetic energy to move around\n- Can flow from place to place\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- **No fixed shape**: Liquid takes shape of container it occupies\n- **Fixed volume**: Liquid has definite volume\n- **Nearly incompressible**: Slight compression possible (but much less than gases)\n- **Moderate density**: Between solids and gases\n- **Flows**: Liquid can be poured and flows under gravity\n\n**Examples**: Water (H₂O), oil, mercury, petrol\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Nigeria's crude oil and refined petroleum products (petrol, diesel) are liquids transported through pipelines and refineries.\n\n---\n\n**3.

      "duration_minutes": 25,
      "content": "**Phase Changes** (or state changes) occur when matter converts from one state to another.\n\nAll phase changes involve energy transfer:\n- **Endothermic**: Heat absorbed (melting, boiling, sublimation)\n- **Exothermic**: Heat released (condensation, freezing, deposition)\n\n---\n\n**1. MELTING (Solid → Liquid)**\n\n**Definition**: Melting is the phase change from solid to liquid when heat is absorbed.\n\n**What happens**:\n- Heat provides energy to particles\n- Particles vibrate more vigorously\n- Intermolecular bonds break\n- Particles gain freedom to move (but stay close)\n- Result: Liquid state\n\n**Melting Point**: Temperature at which solid becomes liquid\n\n**Examples**:\n- Ice melts at 0°C (273 K)\n- Iron melts at 1538°C\n- Table salt melts at 801°C\n\n**Endothermic process**: Heat is absorbed\n- Q = m × L_f (latent heat of fusion)\n\n---\n\n**2. FREEZING (Liquid → Solid)**\n\n**Definition**: Freezing is the phase change from liquid to solid when heat is removed.\n\n**What happens**:\n- Heat is removed\n- Particle motion decreases\n- Intermolecular forces become dominant\n- Particles settle into fixed crystal structure\n- Result: Solid state\n\n**Freezing Point**: Temperature at which liquid becomes solid\n\n**Examples**:\n- Water freezes at 0°C (273 K)\n- Oil freezes at lower temperature (more flexible)\n\n**Exothermic process**: Heat is released\n\n---\n\n**3. BOILING (Liquid → Gas)**\n\n**Definition**: Boiling is the phase change from liquid to gas when enough heat is absorbed to break all intermolecular bonds.\n\n**What happens**:\n- Heat absorbed provides energy\n- Particles move very fast\n- Intermolecular forces overcome completely\n- Particles escape to gaseous state\n- Result: Gas state\n\n**Boiling Point**: Temperature at which liquid becomes gas\n\n**Examples**:\n- Water boils at 100°C (373 K) at 1 atm pressure\n- Petrol boils at ~70°C (volatile)\n- Different at different atmospheric pressures\n\n**Endothermic process**: Heat absorbed\n- Q = m × L_v (latent heat of vaporization)\n- L_v >> L_f (much more energy needed for boiling than melting)\n\n---\n\n**4. CONDENSATION (Gas → Liquid)**\n\n**Definition**: Condensation is the phase change from gas to liquid when heat is removed.\n\n**What happens**:\n- Heat is removed\n- Particle speed decreases\n- Intermolecular forces recapture particles\n- Particles come together into liquid state\n- Result: Liquid state\n\n**Condensation Temperature**: Same as boiling point (reverse process)\n\n**Examples**:\n- Water vapor condenses to liquid water at 100°C (at 1 atm)\n- Dew formation on cold surfaces\n\n**Exothermic process**: Heat is released\n\n---\n\n**5. SUBLIMATION (Solid → Gas)**\n\n**Definition**: Sublimation is direct phase change from solid to gas without passing through liquid state.\n\n**What happens**:\n- Heat absorbed provides energy\n- Particles break free directly from solid arrangement\n- Particles become gaseous without intermediate liquid state\n- Result: Gas state\n\n**Examples**:\n- Dry ice (solid CO₂) sublimes at -78°C\n- Iodine crystals sublime to purple vapor\n- Mothballs (naphthalene) sublime in air\n\n**Endothermic process**: Heat absorbed\n\n---\n\n**6. DEPOSITION (Gas → Solid)**\n\n**Definition**: Deposition is direct phase change from gas to solid without passing through liquid state.\n\n**What happens**:\n- Heat is removed\n- Gas particles lose energy rapidly\n- Particles settle directly into solid crystal structure\n- Result: Solid state\n\n**Examples**:\n- Frost formation on cold grass (water vapor → ice)\n- Iodine vapor → iodine crystals\n\n**Exothermic process**: Heat is released\n\n---\n\n**Phase Diagram**\n\nA phase diagram shows which state is stable at given pressure and temperature.\n\n**Key Features**:\n- **Triple point**: Temperature/pressure where all three states coexist\n- **Critical point**: Temperature/pressure above which liquid and gas cannot be distinguished\n- **Solid region**: Low temperature, high pressure\n- **Liquid region**: Intermediate temperature and pressure\n- **Gas region**: High temperature, low pressure\n\n**Nigerian Context**: In NNPC refineries in Port Harcourt, understanding phase changes is crucial. Crude oil components have different boiling points, allowing separation through fractional distillation: heavy fractions (fuel oil) boil at high temps, light fractions (petrol) at low temps."

GAY-LUSSAC'S LAW (Pressure-Temperature Relationship)**\n\n**Statement**: At constant volume, pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature.\n\n**Formula**: **P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂** (at constant V)\n\nor: **P ∝ T** (absolute temperature)\n\n**Interpretation**:\n- If temperature increases → pressure increases\n- If temperature decreases → pressure decreases\n\n**Example**: Sealed container with gas\n- Heat container (increase T) → pressure increases\n- Cool container (decrease T) → pressure decreases\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Tires in parked vehicles in hot Lagos expand as temperature rises due to pressure increase inside the tire.\n\n---\n\n**4. IDEAL GAS LAW**\n\n**Combines all three relationships**:\n\n**PV = nRT**\n\nwhere:\n- P = pressure (Pa or atm)\n- V = volume (m³ or L)\n- n = number of moles\n- R = gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K) or 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K))\n- T = absolute temperature (Kelvin)\n\n**Using the Ideal Gas Law**:\n\nExample: Calculate pressure of 2 moles of gas at 300 K in 10 L container\n- PV = nRT\n- P(10) = 2(8.314)(300) / 1000 (converting to L·atm)\n- P = 4.988 atm ≈ 5 atm\n\n**Assumptions of Ideal Gas**:\n- Particles have negligible volume\n- Intermolecular forces negligible\n- Collisions are elastic\n- Average kinetic energy ∝ temperature\n\n**Real vs Ideal Gases**:\n- Real gases deviate at high pressures and low temperatures\n- Most gases behave ideally at room conditions\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Natural gas from Niger Delta facilities must be compressed for storage and transport.
