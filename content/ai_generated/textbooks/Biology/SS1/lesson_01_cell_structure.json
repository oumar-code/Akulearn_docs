Unicellular organisms (e.g., bacteria) consist of one cell, while multicellular organisms (e.g., humans, maize) have many specialized cells.\n\n**Common Features of Cells**\n- Cell membrane: selectively permeable boundary controlling entry/exit of substances\n- Cytoplasm: semi-fluid medium containing organelles and dissolved substances\n- Genetic material: DNA (in nucleus or nucleoid) that controls cell activities\n\n**Plant vs Animal Cells (High-Level)**\n- Plant cells: have cell wall, chloroplasts, large central vacuole\n- Animal cells: no cell wall, no chloroplasts, small or temporary vacuoles\n\n**Nigerian Context**: In Lagos teaching hospitals, understanding cell structure helps medical lab scientists interpret blood smears and tissue biopsies. In agriculture across Kaduna and Benue, plant cell knowledge supports crop improvement."

      "duration_minutes": 23,
      "content": "**Key Organelles**\n\n- Nucleus: houses DNA; controls cell activities; contains nucleolus for ribosome assembly\n- Mitochondria: site of aerobic respiration; produce ATP energy\n- Ribosomes: protein synthesis; free in cytoplasm or on rough ER\n- Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER): transports proteins; studded with ribosomes\n- Smooth ER: lipid synthesis and detoxification\n- Golgi apparatus: modifies, packages, and ships proteins/lipids\n- Lysosomes: contain digestive enzymes; break down waste (mainly in animal cells)\n- Chloroplasts: photosynthesis in plant cells; contain chlorophyll\n- Vacuole: storage and turgor pressure; large central vacuole in plant cells\n- Cell wall: cellulose support layer in plants; absent in animals\n- Cell membrane: phospholipid bilayer with proteins; controls transport\n\n**Organelle Interactions**\nProteins made in ribosomes → processed in RER → packaged in Golgi → sent to membrane or organelles. Mitochondria provide ATP for these processes.\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Food scientists in Ibadan analyze plant cell walls to improve cassava processing. Pharmacologists study lysosomes and detoxification pathways for drug development in malaria treatment."
