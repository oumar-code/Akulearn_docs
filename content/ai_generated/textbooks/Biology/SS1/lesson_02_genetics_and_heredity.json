Identify parental genotypes\n2. List possible gametes\n3. Fill grid to show offspring combinations\n4. Calculate genotype and phenotype ratios\n\n**Examples**\n- Tall (TT) × Short (tt) → all Tt (tall) in F1\n- Selfing F1 (Tt × Tt) → 3 tall : 1 short phenotype ratio\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Crop breeding programs at IITA Ibadan use Mendelian principles to combine disease resistance and high yield traits in cassava and maize."
