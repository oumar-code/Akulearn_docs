      "content": "**The Five-Paragraph Essay Structure**\n\nThe basic essay has three parts: **Introduction, Body, Conclusion**.\n\n**INTRODUCTION (1 paragraph)**\n- **Hook**: Grab reader's attention (question, quote, interesting fact, anecdote)\n- **Background**: Provide context, define key terms\n- **Thesis Statement**: Main argument or point (last sentence of intro)\n\nExample Intro:\n*Hook:* \"What makes a great leader?\"\n*Background:* \"Throughout history, leaders have shaped nations. In Nigeria, leaders like Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe fought for independence.\"\n*Thesis:* \"A great leader possesses vision, integrity, and the ability to inspire others.\"\n\n**BODY (3 paragraphs, one for each main point)**\n\nEach body paragraph follows **TEEL/PEEL structure**:\n- **T (Topic Sentence)**: Introduces paragraph's main idea (supports thesis)\n- **E (Explanation)**: Explains the point in detail\n- **E (Evidence/Example)**: Provides specific examples, facts, quotes\n- **L (Link)**: Connects back to thesis or transitions to next paragraph\n\nExample Body Paragraph:\n*Topic Sentence:* \"First, a great leader must have clear vision.\"\n*Explanation:* \"Vision means seeing the future and setting goals to achieve it.\"\n*Evidence:* \"Dr. Azikiwe envisioned an independent Nigeria and worked tirelessly toward that goal.\"\n*Link:* \"Without vision, a leader cannot guide a nation forward.\"\n\n**CONCLUSION (1 paragraph)**\n- **Restate Thesis**: Summarize main argument (in different words)\n- **Summarize Key Points**: Briefly recap three main ideas\n- **Closing Statement**: Final thought, call to action, or broader implication\n\nExample Conclusion:\n\"In conclusion, effective leadership requires vision, integrity, and inspiration. These qualities enable leaders like Azikiwe to transform nations. As future leaders, we must cultivate these traits to build a better Nigeria.\"\n\n**Thesis Statement**\n\nA thesis statement:\n- States main argument/claim\n- Appears at end of introduction\n- Guides entire essay\n- Is specific and debatable (not obvious fact)\n\n**Good Thesis**: \"The Nigerian government should invest more in renewable energy to combat climate change and create jobs.\"\n**Weak Thesis**: \"Climate change is bad.\" (Too vague, not debatable)\n\n**Topic Sentences**\n\nTopic sentences:\n- Begin each body paragraph\n- State paragraph's main idea\n- Support thesis statement\n- Preview what paragraph will discuss\n\n**Transitions**\n\nTransition words connect ideas smoothly:\n- **Addition**: furthermore, moreover, additionally, also\n- **Contrast**: however, on the other hand, nevertheless, although\n- **Example**: for instance, for example, specifically\n- **Sequence**: first, second, finally, next, then\n- **Conclusion**: in conclusion, therefore, thus, consequently\n\n**Coherence and Unity**\n\n**Coherence**: Ideas flow logically; sentences connect smoothly\n**Unity**: All sentences in paragraph support topic sentence; all paragraphs support thesis\n\n**Nigerian Context**: When writing about Nigerian issues (education, economy, culture), organize ideas clearly. For WAEC exams, five-paragraph structure provides solid framework."

      "content": "**1. NARRATIVE ESSAY**\n\nTells a story from personal experience or imagination.\n\n**Features**:\n- First or third person\n- Chronological order (time sequence)\n- Vivid descriptions and dialogue\n- Shows character development\n- Has plot (beginning, middle, end)\n\n**Structure**:\n- **Intro**: Set scene, introduce characters/conflict\n- **Body**: Tell story events in order, build to climax\n- **Conclusion**: Resolve conflict, reflect on significance\n\n**Example Topic**: \"A Day I Will Never Forget\"\n*Narrative*: Describe a memorable experience (winning competition, moving to new city, family event). Use descriptive language and show emotions.\n\n**2. DESCRIPTIVE ESSAY**\n\nDescribes person, place, object, or event using sensory details.\n\n**Features**:\n- Appeals to five senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch)\n- Uses figurative language (similes, metaphors)\n- Creates vivid mental picture\n- Organized spatially (top to bottom, near to far) or by importance\n\n**Example Topic**: \"The Lagos Market\"\n*Description*: \"The market buzzes with energy. Vendors shout prices, hawkers weave through crowds. The aroma of roasted plantain mingles with fresh fish. Colorful fabrics—ankara, adire—cascade from stalls. The air is thick, humid, alive with commerce.\"\n\n**3. EXPOSITORY ESSAY**\n\nExplains or informs about a topic objectively.\n\n**Features**:\n- Third person\n- Presents facts, not opinions\n- Clear, straightforward language\n- Logical organization\n\n**Types**:\n- **Process**: Explains how to do something (\"How to Prepare Jollof Rice\")\n- **Cause-Effect**: Shows reasons and results (\"Effects of Deforestation in Nigeria\")\n- **Compare-Contrast**: Examines similarities/differences (\"Traditional vs. Modern Education\")\n- **Definition**: Explains a concept (\"What is Democracy?\")\n\n**Example Topic**: \"The Nigerian Educational System\"\n*Exposition*: Explain structure (primary, secondary, tertiary), curriculum, challenges, reforms. Use facts and statistics.\n\n**4. ARGUMENTATIVE/PERSUASIVE ESSAY**\n\nPersuades reader to accept a viewpoint or take action.\n\n**Features**:\n- Clear thesis stating position\n- Logical arguments supported by evidence (facts, statistics, expert quotes)\n- Addresses counterarguments (opposing views)\n- Appeals to logic (logos), emotion (pathos), credibility (ethos)\n\n**Structure**:\n- **Intro**: State issue and thesis (your position)\n- **Body Para 1-2**: Present arguments with evidence\n- **Body Para 3**: Address counterargument and refute\n- **Conclusion**: Restate position, call to action\n\n**Example Topic**: \"Should School Uniforms Be Mandatory?\"\n*Argument*: Take position (yes or no), provide reasons (promotes equality, reduces distractions, OR limits self-expression, costly for families), support with evidence, refute opposing view.\n\n**Developing Paragraphs**\n\n**Show, Don't Tell**: Use specific details, not vague statements.\n- **Weak**: \"The teacher was nice.\"\n- **Strong**: \"The teacher smiled warmly, patiently explaining the math problem for the third time.\"\n\n**Use Examples**: Concrete examples make abstract ideas clear.\n- Claim: \"Education improves lives.\"\n- Example: \"In rural Kano, a literacy program enabled women to start small businesses, lifting families out of poverty.\"\n\n**Nigerian Context**: WAEC often asks for essays on Nigerian topics (leadership, education, environment, culture). Practice all four types. Narrative/descriptive suit creative writing; expository/argumentative suit formal topics."
