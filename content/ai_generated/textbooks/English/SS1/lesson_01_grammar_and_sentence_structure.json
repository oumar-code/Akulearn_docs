      "content": "**The Eight Parts of Speech**\n\nEvery word in English belongs to one of eight categories called parts of speech.\n\n**1. NOUNS**\n- Definition: Words that name people, places, things, or ideas\n- Types: Proper nouns (capitalize), common nouns, abstract nouns, collective nouns\n- Examples: Lagos, student, happiness, team\n\n**2. PRONOUNS**\n- Definition: Words that replace nouns\n- Types: Personal (I, you, he), possessive (my, your), reflexive (myself), relative (who, which)\n- Examples: She went to Abuja. The book which I read was interesting.\n\n**3. VERBS**\n- Definition: Action or state-of-being words\n- Types: Action verbs (run, write), linking verbs (is, seem), auxiliary verbs (have, will)\n- Examples: The student studies. Lagos is busy.\n\n**4. ADJECTIVES**\n- Definition: Words that describe nouns\n- Examples: beautiful, Nigerian, three, many\n- Position: Usually before noun or after linking verb\n\n**5. ADVERBS**\n- Definition: Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs\n- Types: Manner (quickly), time (yesterday), place (here), degree (very)\n- Examples: She speaks fluently. He arrived early.\n\n**6. PREPOSITIONS**\n- Definition: Words showing relationships between nouns/pronouns and other words\n- Common: in, on, at, by, with, from, to, under, between\n- Examples: The book is on the table. She traveled from Lagos to Ibadan.\n\n**7. CONJUNCTIONS**\n- Definition: Words that connect words, phrases, or clauses\n- Coordinating: and, but, or, so, for, yet, nor\n- Subordinating: because, although, when, if, since\n- Examples: He studied hard, so he passed. Although it rained, we went out.\n\n**8. INTERJECTIONS**\n- Definition: Words expressing emotion or exclamation\n- Examples: Oh! Wow! Alas! Hey!\n\n**Nigerian Context**: In Nigerian English, parts of speech function the same way. \"The Lagos traffic is terrible\" uses: The (determiner/adjective), Lagos (proper noun), traffic (noun), is (verb), terrible (adjective)."

      "duration_minutes": 22,
      "content": "**What is a Sentence?**\n\nA sentence is a group of words expressing a complete thought. Must have a subject and a predicate.\n\n**Sentence Elements**:\n- **Subject**: Who/what the sentence is about\n- **Predicate**: What the subject does or is (contains verb)\n- **Object**: Receives action of verb (if present)\n- **Complement**: Completes meaning after linking verb\n\n**Example**: The student (subject) wrote (predicate/verb) a letter (object).\n\n**Four Types by Purpose**:\n\n1. **Declarative** (statement): Makes a statement, ends with period\n   - Example: Nigeria gained independence in 1960.\n\n2. **Interrogative** (question): Asks a question, ends with question mark\n   - Example: Where is the University of Lagos?\n\n3. **Imperative** (command): Gives command/request, ends with period or exclamation\n   - Example: Close the door. Study hard!\n\n4. **Exclamatory** (exclamation): Shows strong emotion, ends with exclamation mark\n   - Example: What a beautiful sunset!\n\n**Four Types by Structure**:\n\n**1. SIMPLE SENTENCE**\n- One independent clause (one subject, one verb)\n- Structure: Subject + Verb (+ Object/Complement)\n- Example: The teacher teaches English.\n- Example: Lagos is Nigeria's commercial capital.\n\n**2. COMPOUND SENTENCE**\n- Two or more independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunction\n- Structure: Independent clause + conjunction + Independent clause\n- Example: I studied hard, and I passed the exam.\n- Example: She wanted to go to Abuja, but she had no money.\n\n**3. COMPLEX SENTENCE**\n- One independent clause + one or more dependent clauses\n- Dependent clause begins with subordinating conjunction\n- Example: Although it rained, we went to school.\n- Example: The student who studied hard passed the exam.\n\n**4. COMPOUND-COMPLEX SENTENCE**\n- Two or more independent clauses + one or more dependent clauses\n- Example: When the rain stopped, the students went outside, and they played football.\n\n**Nigerian Context**: In formal Nigerian writing (newspapers, official documents), compound and complex sentences show sophistication. \"Although Nigeria has oil resources, many citizens still face poverty\" is complex."

      "duration_minutes": 23,
      "content": "**Tense Overview**\n\nTense shows when an action happens (past, present, future).\n\n**Present Tense**:\n- **Simple Present**: Habitual actions, general truths\n  - Form: base verb (add -s for 3rd person singular)\n  - Examples: I study. She studies. Nigeria has 36 states.\n\n- **Present Continuous**: Actions happening now\n  - Form: am/is/are + verb-ing\n  - Examples: I am reading. They are traveling to Lagos.\n\n- **Present Perfect**: Actions completed recently or with present relevance\n  - Form: have/has + past participle\n  - Examples: I have finished. She has visited Abuja three times.\n\n- **Present Perfect Continuous**: Actions started in past, continuing now\n  - Form: have/has been + verb-ing\n  - Examples: I have been studying for two hours.\n\n**Past Tense**:\n- **Simple Past**: Completed actions in past\n  - Form: verb + -ed (regular) or irregular form\n  - Examples: I walked. She went. Nigeria gained independence in 1960.\n\n- **Past Continuous**: Actions in progress in past\n  - Form: was/were + verb-ing\n  - Examples: I was reading when you called.\n\n- **Past Perfect**: Actions completed before another past action\n  - Form: had + past participle\n  - Examples: I had finished before she arrived.\n\n- **Past Perfect Continuous**: Ongoing past action before another past action\n  - Form: had been + verb-ing\n  - Examples: They had been waiting for an hour when the bus came.\n\n**Future Tense**:\n- **Simple Future**: Actions that will happen\n  - Form: will/shall + base verb\n  - Examples: I will study. Nigeria will host the conference.\n\n- **Future Continuous**: Actions in progress at future time\n  - Form: will be + verb-ing\n  - Examples: This time tomorrow, I will be traveling.\n\n- **Future Perfect**: Actions completed before future time\n  - Form: will have + past participle\n  - Examples: By next year, I will have graduated.\n\n**Nigerian Context**: In Nigerian formal English, present perfect is common: \"The government has announced new policies.\" Simple past for specific past events: \"The president visited Lagos yesterday.\""

      "duration_minutes": 22,
      "content": "**Subject-Verb Agreement**\n\nSubject and verb must agree in number (singular/plural) and person.\n\n**Basic Rules**:\n\n1. **Singular subject → singular verb**\n   - The student is here. (not \"are\")\n   - Lagos has many people. (not \"have\")\n\n2. **Plural subject → plural verb**\n   - The students are here. (not \"is\")\n   - They have arrived.

It works.\n\n**Special Cases**:\n\n**Compound Subjects**:\n- Joined by \"and\" → plural verb\n  - Tom and Jerry are friends.\n- Joined by \"or\"/\"nor\" → verb agrees with nearest subject\n  - Either the teacher or the students are responsible.\n  - Neither the students nor the teacher is responsible.\n\n**Collective Nouns**:\n- Usually singular in British/Nigerian English\n  - The team is winning. (team as unit)\n  - The government has decided.\n- Can be plural if emphasizing individuals\n  - The team are arguing among themselves.\n\n**Indefinite Pronouns**:\n- Singular: each, every, everyone, everybody, anyone, anybody, someone, somebody, no one, nobody, either, neither\n  - Everyone is here. Each student has a book.\n- Plural: both, few, many, several\n  - Both are correct. Many have arrived.\n- Either singular or plural (depends on context): some, all, most, none\n  - Some of the water is clean. (water = uncountable)\n  - Some of the students are absent. (students = countable)\n\n**Common Errors in Nigerian English**:\n- ❌ The government are planning (British influence)\n  ✅ The government is planning (standard Nigerian usage)\n- ❌ Everyone have finished\n  ✅ Everyone has finished\n- ❌ The students has arrived\n  ✅ The students have arrived\n\n**Nigerian Context**: In formal Nigerian writing (newspapers, official reports), strict subject-verb agreement is expected. \"The Nigerian economy is growing\" (singular). \"Nigerian students are excelling\" (plural)."
