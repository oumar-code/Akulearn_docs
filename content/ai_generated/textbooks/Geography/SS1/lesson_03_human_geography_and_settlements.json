      "duration_minutes": 23,
      "content": "**Migration**: movement of people from one place to another (internal/external; rural-urban, urban-rural). **Push factors**: unemployment, conflict, poor services. **Pull factors**: jobs, education, health, safety. \n\n**Urbanization**: increasing share of people living in urban areas. Causes: industrialization, services growth, rural push factors. \n\n**Nigerian context**: Rural–urban migration to Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt for jobs and education; creates pressure on housing, transport, water, waste management."

      "duration_minutes": 22,
      "content": "Cultural geography studies how culture varies across space (language, religion, traditions). Nigeria is culturally diverse (Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, many others). \n\n**Human-environment interaction**: how humans adapt to, modify, and depend on environment. Examples: irrigation in dry zones, deforestation for farming, building flood defenses. \n\n**Environmental impacts**: urban sprawl, pollution, loss of green areas. Sustainable planning seeks balance."
