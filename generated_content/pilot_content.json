      "content": "# Quadratic Equations: Mastery Guide\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nA **quadratic equation** is a polynomial equation of degree 2, written in the standard form:\n\n**ax² + bx + c = 0**\n\nWhere:\n- a, b, c are constants (a ≠ 0)\n- x is the variable\n- a is the coefficient of x²\n- b is the coefficient of x\n- c is the constant term\n\n## 2. Methods of Solving Quadratic Equations\n\n### Method 1: Factorization\n\n**When to use**: When the equation can be easily factored\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Write equation in standard form (ax² + bx + c = 0)\n2. Factor the left side into two binomials\n3. Set each factor equal to zero\n4. Solve for x\n\n**Example**: x² - 5x + 6 = 0\n- Factor: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n- Solutions: x = 2 or x = 3\n\n### Method 2: Completing the Square\n\n**When to use**: When factorization is difficult, or to derive the quadratic formula\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Move constant to right side\n2. Make coefficient of x² equal to 1\n3. Add (b/2)² to both sides\n4. Take square root of both sides\n5. Solve for x\n\n**Example**: x² + 6x + 5 = 0\n- x² + 6x = -5\n- x² + 6x + 9 = -5 + 9\n- (x + 3)² = 4\n- x + 3 = ±2\n- x = -3 ± 2\n- Solutions: x = -1 or x = -5\n\n### Method 3: Quadratic Formula (Most Powerful!)\n\nFor any quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0:\n\n**x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a**\n\n**Discriminant (Δ)**: b² - 4ac\n\nNature of roots:\n- If Δ > 0: Two distinct real roots\n- If Δ = 0: One repeated real root\n- If Δ < 0: No real roots (complex roots)\n\n## 3. Nigerian Context Examples\n\n### Example 1: Market Pricing (Lagos)\nA trader at Idumota Market sells phones. The profit P (in Naira) is given by:\nP = -2x² + 120x - 1000\n\nWhere x is the number of phones sold per day.\n\n**Question**: How many phones should be sold to break even (P = 0)?\n\n**Solution**:\n-2x² + 120x - 1000 = 0\nDivide by -2: x² - 60x + 500 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\nx = [60 ± √(3600 - 2000)] / 2\nx = [60 ± √1600] / 2\nx = [60 ± 40] / 2\n\nx = 50 or x = 10\n\n**Answer**: The trader breaks even by selling either 10 or 50 phones per day.\n\n### Example 2: Construction (Abuja)\nA rectangular plot in Abuja has length 5m more than its width. The area is 300m².\n\n**Find**: The dimensions of the plot.\n\n**Solution**:\nLet width = x meters\nLength = (x + 5) meters\nArea: x(x + 5) = 300\nx² + 5x - 300 = 0\n\nFactor or use formula:\nx = [-5 ± √(25 + 1200)] / 2\nx = [-5 ± 35] / 2\n\nx = 15 or x = -20 (reject negative)\n\n**Answer**: Width = 15m, Length = 20m\n\n## 4. Graphing Quadratic Functions\n\nThe graph of y = ax² + bx + c is a **parabola**.\n\n**Key Features**:\n- **Vertex**: Turning point at x = -b/2a\n- **Axis of symmetry**: Vertical line through vertex\n- **Y-intercept**: Point (0, c)\n- **X-intercepts**: Roots of the equation\n\n**Direction**:\n- If a > 0: Opens upward (U-shape)\n- If a < 0: Opens downward (∩-shape)\n\n## 5. Exam Tips for WAEC\n\n✅ **Always check your discriminant first** - it tells you how many solutions to expect\n\n✅ **Show all working** - even if you use calculator, write down the formula and substitution\n\n✅ **Check your solutions** by substituting back into the original equation\n\n✅ **Watch for word problems** - translate Nigerian context into equations carefully\n\n✅ **Remember units** - if the problem mentions Naira (₦), meters, or time, include units in your answer\n\n## 6. Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n❌ Forgetting the ± sign in the quadratic formula\n❌ Arithmetic errors when calculating discriminant\n❌ Dividing by 2a instead of 2 in the formula\n❌ Not writing equation in standard form first\n❌ Accepting negative solutions for length, time, or quantity problems\n\n## 7. Practice Problems (Self-Check)\n\nSolve using any method:\n\n1. x² - 7x + 12 = 0\n2. 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0\n3. x² - 6x + 9 = 0\n4. x² + 4x + 5 = 0 (Find nature of roots)\n\n**Challenge Problem**: \nA ball is thrown upward from ground level in Port Harcourt. Its height h (in meters) after t seconds is:\nh = -5t² + 20t\n\nFind: (a) Maximum height reached\n      (b) Time when ball hits the ground\n\n## Summary\n\n- Three main solving methods: Factorization, Completing the Square, Quadratic Formula\n- Discriminant determines nature of roots\n- Real-world applications: projectiles, area, profit maximization\n- Always check your work by substitution\n",

      "content": "# Current Electricity: Complete Guide\n\n## 1. Fundamental Concepts\n\n### Electric Current (I)\n- **Definition**: Rate of flow of electric charge\n- **Formula**: I = Q/t\n- **Unit**: Ampere (A) or Coulomb per second (C/s)\n- **Direction**: Conventional current flows from positive to negative\n\n### Potential Difference/Voltage (V)\n- **Definition**: Work done per unit charge\n- **Formula**: V = W/Q\n- **Unit**: Volt (V) or Joule per Coulomb (J/C)\n- **Meaning**: \"Electrical pressure\" that pushes charges\n\n### Resistance (R)\n- **Definition**: Opposition to current flow\n- **Formula**: R = ρL/A (where ρ = resistivity, L = length, A = area)\n- **Unit**: Ohm (Ω)\n- **Factors**: Material, length, cross-sectional area, temperature\n\n## 2. Ohm's Law ⭐⭐⭐\n\n**V = IR**\n\nMost important formula in electricity!\n\nIf you know any two quantities, you can find the third:\n- V = IR (voltage equals current times resistance)\n- I = V/R (current equals voltage divided by resistance)\n- R = V/I (resistance equals voltage divided by current)\n\n## 3. Series Circuits\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Current is **same** through all components: I = I₁ = I₂ = I₃\n- Voltage is **shared**: V = V₁ + V₂ + V₃\n- Total resistance **adds up**: Rtotal = R₁ + R₂ + R₃\n\n**When to use**: Christmas lights, simple torch circuits\n\n## 4. Parallel Circuits\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Voltage is **same** across all branches: V = V₁ = V₂ = V₃\n- Current is **shared**: I = I₁ + I₂ + I₃\n- Reciprocal of total resistance: 1/Rtotal = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃\n\n**When to use**: Home wiring, appliances that need same voltage\n\n## 5. Electrical Power and Energy\n\n**Power Formulas**:\n- P = VI (most common)\n- P = I²R (useful when you know current and resistance)\n- P = V²/R (useful when you know voltage and resistance)\n\n**Energy**: E = Pt (Energy = Power × Time)\n\n**Cost of Electricity** (Nigerian Context):\nCost = Energy (kWh) × Tariff (₦/kWh)\n\n## 6. Nigerian Context: NEPA/PHCN Calculations\n\n### Example: Monthly Electricity Bill in Lagos\n\n**Appliances in a home**:\n- 5 LED bulbs (10W each) × 6 hours/day\n- 1 Fan (75W) × 8 hours/day\n- 1 TV (100W) × 4 hours/day\n- 1 Fridge (150W) × 24 hours/day\n\n**Monthly consumption**:\n- Bulbs: 5 × 10W × 6h × 30 days = 9 kWh\n- Fan: 75W × 8h × 30 = 18 kWh\n- TV: 100W × 4h × 30 = 12 kWh\n- Fridge: 150W × 24h × 30 = 108 kWh\n- **Total**: 147 kWh/month\n\n**Cost** (at ₦68/kWh):\n147 kWh × ₦68 = ₦9,996 per month\n\n## 7. WAEC Exam Tips\n\n✅ **Always write formulas first** - shows you know the concept\n\n✅ **List given values** - helps you organize your solution\n\n✅ **Show unit conversions** - mA to A, kW to W, etc.\n\n✅ **Draw circuit diagrams** when asked - label all components\n\n✅ **Check your answer** - Does the current make sense? Is resistance positive?\n\n## 8. Common Mistakes\n\n❌ Forgetting to convert units (mA to A, kW to W)\n❌ Using series formulas for parallel circuits (and vice versa)\n❌ Mixing up voltage division vs current division\n❌ Not showing working - even if you use calculator\n❌ Wrong formula for parallel resistance (don't just add!)\n\n## Summary\n\n- Ohm's Law: V = IR (memorize this!)\n- Series: Same current, voltage adds\n- Parallel: Same voltage, current adds\n- Power: P = VI = I²R = V²/R\n- Practice with Nigerian context problems\n",

Why Atoms Bond\n\nAtoms bond to achieve **stable electron configuration** (usually 8 valence electrons - octet rule).\n\n**Exceptions**: H and He need only 2 electrons (duplet rule).\n\n## 2. Ionic Bonding\n\n### Definition\n- Transfer of electrons from metal to non-metal\n- Forms oppositely charged ions\n- Electrostatic attraction holds ions together\n\n### Example: Sodium Chloride (NaCl)\n- Na (2,8,1) → Na⁺ (2,8) + e⁻\n- Cl (2,8,7) + e⁻ → Cl⁻ (2,8,8)\n- Na⁺Cl⁻ forms ionic compound\n\n### Properties\n✓ High melting/boiling points\n✓ Conduct electricity when molten or in solution\n✓ Hard but brittle crystals\n✓ Soluble in water\n\n### Nigerian Example\nCommon salt from Lagos salt industry - NaCl is ionic compound.\n\n## 3. Covalent Bonding\n\n### Definition\n- Sharing of electron pairs between non-metals\n- Both atoms contribute electrons\n- Strong directional bonds\n\n### Types\n**Single Bond**: 1 pair shared (H-H)\n**Double Bond**: 2 pairs shared (O=O)\n**Triple Bond**: 3 pairs shared (N≡N)\n\n### Example: Water (H₂O)\n- O needs 2 electrons\n- Each H shares 1 electron with O\n- 2 O-H bonds form\n\n### Properties\n✓ Variable melting/boiling points\n✓ Poor electrical conductors\n✓ Can be gases, liquids, or solids\n✓ Variable solubility\n\n## 4. Metallic Bonding\n\n### Definition\n- Bonding in metals\n- Positive metal ions in lattice\n- Delocalized \"sea of electrons\" moving freely\n\n### Properties\n✓ High electrical/thermal conductivity\n✓ Malleable and ductile\n✓ Metallic luster\n✓ High melting points (usually)\n\n### Nigerian Context\nCopper wiring in Lagos homes - metallic bonding enables conductivity.\n\n## 5.

      "content": "# Reproduction: Continuity of Life\n\n## 1. Types of Reproduction\n\n### Asexual Reproduction\n- **One parent** only\n- **No gametes** (sex cells)\n- Offspring **genetically identical** to parent (clones)\n- **Faster** than sexual reproduction\n\n### Sexual Reproduction\n- **Two parents** (male and female)\n- Involves **gametes** (sperm and egg)\n- Offspring **genetically different** from parents\n- Provides **variation** for adaptation\n\n## 2. Asexual Reproduction Methods\n\n### Binary Fission\n- Single organism splits into two\n- Example: Bacteria, Amoeba\n- Very rapid multiplication\n\n### Budding\n- Small outgrowth (bud) forms on parent\n- Bud detaches and grows independently\n- Example: Yeast, Hydra\n\n### Vegetative Propagation\n- New plants from vegetative parts\n- Examples:\n  * Stem: Cassava, Sugarcane\n  * Root: Sweet potato\n  * Tuber: Yam, Potato\n  * Bulb: Onion, Garlic\n  * Rhizome: Ginger\n\n### Spore Formation\n- Produces many spores\n- Spores dispersed by wind\n- Example: Fungi, Ferns\n\n## 3. Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\n\n### Parts of a Flower\n\n**Male Parts (Stamen)**:\n- Anther: Produces pollen grains\n- Filament: Supports anther\n\n**Female Parts (Carpel/Pistil)**:\n- Stigma: Receives pollen\n- Style: Tube connecting stigma to ovary\n- Ovary: Contains ovules (eggs)\n\n### Pollination\n**Definition**: Transfer of pollen from anther to stigma\n\n**Types**:\n1. **Self-Pollination**: Same flower or same plant\n2. **Cross-Pollination**: Different plants (same species)\n\n**Agents of Pollination**:\n- **Wind**: Light, dry pollen; abundant; feathery stigma (e.g., maize, grasses)\n- **Insects**: Bright colors, nectar, scent, sticky pollen (e.g., hibiscus, sunflower)\n- **Birds**: Bright red/orange, lots of nectar (e.g., bird of paradise)\n- **Water**: Aquatic plants\n\n### Fertilization\n1. Pollen lands on stigma\n2. Pollen tube grows down style\n3. Male nucleus travels through tube\n4. Reaches ovary, fuses with egg\n5. Forms zygote → embryo → seed\n6. Ovary becomes fruit\n\n## 4. Sexual Reproduction in Humans\n\n### Male Reproductive System\n- Testes: Produce sperm and testosterone\n- Sperm duct: Transports sperm\n- Penis: Delivers sperm\n\n### Female Reproductive System\n- Ovaries: Produce eggs (ova) and hormones\n- Fallopian tubes: Site of fertilization\n- Uterus: Where baby develops\n- Vagina: Birth canal\n\n### Fertilization\n- Sperm meets egg in fallopian tube\n- Fusion forms zygote\n- Zygote implants in uterus\n- Develops into embryo → fetus → baby\n- **Gestation period**: 9 months (280 days)\n\n## 5. Nigerian Agricultural Context\n\n### Asexual Reproduction in Farming\n- **Cassava**: Stem cuttings planted\n- **Yam**: Seed yam (tuber piece) planted\n- **Plantain**: Suckers transplanted\n- **Advantages**: Faster, maintains good traits\n\n### Sexual Reproduction in Farming\n- **Maize**: Pollinated by wind, grows from seed\n- **Tomatoes**: Insect-pollinated, grows from seed\n- **Advantages**: Produces variation, disease resistance\n\n## 6. WAEC Exam Tips\n\n✅ **Label flower diagrams** clearly (stigma, anther, ovary, etc.)\n✅ **Distinguish** self vs cross-pollination\n✅ **State agents** of pollination with examples\n✅ **Compare** asexual vs sexual reproduction\n✅ **Use Nigerian examples** (cassava, yam, maize)\n✅ **Know fertilization process** step-by-step\n\n## 7. Common WAEC Questions\n\n1. Explain the term pollination\n2. State 3 differences between asexual and sexual reproduction\n3. Draw and label parts of a flower\n4. Describe fertilization in flowering plants\n5. Name 2 crops propagated vegetatively\n\n## Practice Questions\n\n1. What is the male gamete in plants?\n2. Where does fertilization occur in humans?\n3. Give 2 advantages of sexual reproduction\n4. Name the process by which yam is propagated\n5. State 3 agents of cross-pollination\n\n## Summary\n\n- Two main types: Asexual (one parent) and Sexual (two parents)\n- Asexual: Binary fission, budding, vegetative propagation, spores\n- Sexual (plants): Pollination → Fertilization → Seed formation\n- Nigerian crops: Cassava (asexual), Maize (sexual)\n- Sexual reproduction provides variation for adaptation\n",
