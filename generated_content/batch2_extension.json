Understanding these substances connects chemistry to Nigerian industries and daily life.\n\n## Part 1: Properties of Acids\n\n### Common Nigerian Acids\n- **Car battery acid** (sulfuric acid, H\u2082SO\u2084) - Lagos battery markets\n- **Vinegar** (acetic acid, CH\u2083COOH) - Nigerian cooking\n- **Citrus fruits** (citric acid) - Oranges, lemons\n- **Stomach acid** (hydrochloric acid, HCl) - Digestion\n\n### Acid Properties\n1. Sour taste (citrus fruits)\n2. Turn blue litmus paper red\n3. pH < 7\n4. React with metals to produce hydrogen gas\n5. React with carbonates to produce CO\u2082\n6. Neutralize bases\n\n### Worked Example 1: Car Battery Acid Reaction\nA mechanic in Lagos adds zinc metal to dilute sulfuric acid from a battery.\n\n**Reaction**: Zn + H\u2082SO\u2084 \u2192 ZnSO\u2084 + H\u2082\n\n**Observation**: Bubbles of hydrogen gas, zinc dissolves\n\n**Test**: Light a splint near gas \u2192 'pop' sound confirms H\u2082\n\n**Nigerian Context**: This reaction shows why battery terminals corrode over time and need cleaning/replacement (common issue in Nigerian vehicles).\n\n## Part 2: Properties of Bases\n\n### Common Nigerian Bases\n- **Lime** (calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)\u2082) - Building construction\n- **Caustic soda** (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) - Soap making\n- **Wood ash** (potassium hydroxide, KOH) - Traditional soap\n- **Ammonia** (NH\u2083) - Cleaning products\n\n### Base Properties\n1. Bitter taste (caution: do not taste!)\n2. Turn red litmus paper blue\n3. pH > 7\n4. Feel slippery/soapy\n5. Neutralize acids\n\n### Worked Example 2: Soap Making in Kano\nTraditional soap makers mix palm oil with wood ash extract (contains KOH).\n\n**Reaction**: Palm oil + KOH \u2192 Soap + Glycerol\n\n**Process**:\n1. Burn palm fronds to get ash\n2. Dissolve ash in water (extracts KOH)\n3. Filter solution\n4. Heat with palm oil for 2-3 hours\n5. Add salt to separate soap\n6. Mold and dry\n\n**Economics**: 10 liters palm oil (\u20a615,000) + ash (free) \u2192 50 bars soap (\u20a620,000 revenue) = \u20a65,000 profit\n\n**Nigerian Industry**: This traditional method is still used alongside modern factories in northern Nigeria.\n\n## Part 3: The pH Scale\n\n### Understanding pH\n- pH = power of Hydrogen\n- Scale: 0 to 14\n- pH 7 = Neutral (pure water)\n- pH < 7 = Acidic\n- pH > 7 = Basic/Alkaline\n\n### Nigerian Examples\n| Substance | pH | Category |\n|-----------|----|----|\n| Car battery acid | 1-2 | Strong acid |\n| Vinegar (Nigerian cooking) | 2-3 | Weak acid |\n| Orange juice | 3-4 | Weak acid |\n| Rain water (Lagos) | 5-6 | Slightly acidic |\n| Pure water | 7 | Neutral |\n| Blood | 7.4 | Slightly alkaline |\n| Antacid (for ulcers) | 9-10 | Base |\n| Lime water (construction) | 12-13 | Strong base |\n| Caustic soda (soap making) | 14 | Strong base |\n\n### Worked Example 3: Treating Ulcers with Antacids\nA patient with stomach acid (pH 2) takes an antacid tablet containing Mg(OH)\u2082.\n\n**Problem**: Explain how antacid works.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Stomach acid: HCl (pH 2, excess acid causes pain)\n- Antacid: Mg(OH)\u2082 (base)\n- **Neutralization**: 2HCl + Mg(OH)\u2082 \u2192 MgCl\u2082 + 2H\u2082O\n- Result: Acid neutralized, pH rises to ~5-6, pain relieved\n\n**Nigerian Market**: Antacids cost \u20a6500-2,000 per pack, common in pharmacies nationwide.\n\n## Part 4: Neutralization Reactions\n\n### General Equation\n**Acid + Base \u2192 Salt + Water**\n\n### Worked Example 4: Lime in Construction (Abuja)\nConstruction workers mix lime Ca(OH)\u2082 with CO\u2082 from air for cement hardening.\n\n**Reaction**: Ca(OH)\u2082 + CO\u2082 \u2192 CaCO\u2083 + H\u2082O\n\n**Process**:\n- Lime paste applied to walls\n- CO\u2082 from air slowly reacts\n- Forms hard calcium carbonate (limestone)\n- Takes weeks to fully harden\n\n**Economics**: 50kg bag lime \u20a63,000, covers 20m\u00b2 of wall\n\n**Nigerian Construction**: Essential for plastering in building projects across Nigeria.\n\n## Part 5: Preparation of Salts\n\n### Method 1: Acid + Metal\n**HCl + Zn \u2192 ZnCl\u2082 + H\u2082**\n\n### Method 2: Acid + Metal Oxide\n**H\u2082SO\u2084 + CuO \u2192 CuSO\u2084 + H\u2082O**\n\n### Method 3: Acid + Metal Carbonate\n**2HCl + CaCO\u2083 \u2192 CaCl\u2082 + H\u2082O + CO\u2082**\n\n### Method 4: Acid + Base (Neutralization)\n**HNO\u2083 + NaOH \u2192 NaNO\u2083 + H\u2082O**\n\n### Worked Example 5: Badagry Salt Production\nAt Badagry salt flats (Lagos State), seawater is evaporated to produce table salt (NaCl).\n\n**Process**:\n1. Seawater pumped into shallow ponds\n2. Sun evaporates water over 2-3 weeks\n3. Salt crystals form (NaCl concentration increases)\n4. Harvest and wash salt\n5. Dry and package\n\n**Yield**: 1000 liters seawater \u2192 30 kg salt (3% concentration)\n\n**Economics**: \n- Production cost: \u20a630/kg (evaporation, labor)\n- Selling price: \u20a650/kg wholesale\n- Annual production: 5,000+ tonnes in Badagry\n\n**Nigerian Industry**: Badagry salt industry employs thousands, supplies Lagos markets.\n\n### Worked Example 6: Preparing Zinc Chloride in Lab\nA student prepares zinc chloride salt from zinc metal and hydrochloric acid.\n\n**Procedure**:\n1. Add excess zinc granules to dilute HCl\n2. Reaction: Zn + 2HCl \u2192 ZnCl\u2082 + H\u2082\u2191\n3. Filter to remove unreacted zinc\n4. Evaporate filtrate to crystallization point\n5. Cool to form ZnCl\u2082 crystals\n6. Dry between filter papers\n\n**Safety**: Wear goggles, acid is corrosive\n\n**WAEC Practical**: Common exam question format\n\n## Part 6: Nigerian Industries Using Acids, Bases, Salts\n\n### Battery Industry (Lagos)\n- Lead-acid batteries use H\u2082SO\u2084\n- Market: Alaba International Market\n- Price: \u20a65,000-25,000 per battery\n- Recycling: Old batteries bought for \u20a61,500\n\n### Soap Manufacturing (Kano)\n- Traditional: Wood ash (KOH) + palm oil\n- Modern: Caustic soda (NaOH) + various oils\n- Annual production: 100,000+ tonnes\n- Employs: 50,000+ workers\n\n### Salt Production (Badagry)\n- Seawater evaporation\n- Annual yield: 5,000+ tonnes\n- Supplies: Lagos markets\n- Price: \u20a650-80/kg wholesale\n\n### Construction (Nationwide)\n- Lime (Ca(OH)\u2082) for plastering\n- Cement neutralization\n- Annual consumption: 500,000+ tonnes\n- Price: \u20a63,000 per 50kg bag\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Memorize neutralization equation**: Acid + Base \u2192 Salt + Water\n2. **pH scale**: Know which substances are acidic/basic\n3. **Litmus tests**: Blue \u2192 red (acid), Red \u2192 blue (base)\n4. **Salt preparation methods**: Choose correct method for given salt\n5. **Balance equations**: Always balance chemical equations\n6. **Safety**: Mention safety precautions in practicals\n7. **Show all steps**: WAEC awards method marks\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: A Nigerian farmer notices his soil pH is 5 (too acidic for crops).

      "content": "\n# Nutrition in Plants: Feeding Nigeria's Farms\n\n## Introduction\nNigeria feeds 220 million people through agriculture. From cassava farms in Benue to cocoa plantations in Ondo, from yam cultivation in Enugu to maize fields in Kaduna\u2014all depend on plant nutrition. Understanding photosynthesis and mineral requirements is essential for Nigerian food security.\n\n## Part 1: Photosynthesis - The Foundation\n\n### The Process\n**6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + light energy \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082**\n(Carbon dioxide + Water \u2192 Glucose + Oxygen)\n\n### Requirements\n1. **Chlorophyll** - Green pigment in chloroplasts\n2. **Light energy** - From sunlight\n3. **Carbon dioxide** - From air (0.04%)\n4. **Water** - From soil via roots\n\n### Products\n1. **Glucose** - Used for energy, growth, storage\n2. **Oxygen** - Released to atmosphere\n\n### Worked Example 1: Cassava Photosynthesis (Benue State)\nA cassava farm in Benue has 10,000 plants. Each plant has ~200 leaves averaging 400 cm\u00b2 per leaf.\n\n**Calculate total photosynthetic surface area**.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Leaves per plant = 200\n- Total plants = 10,000\n- Total leaves = 200 \u00d7 10,000 = 2,000,000 leaves\n- Area per leaf = 400 cm\u00b2 = 0.04 m\u00b2\n- Total area = 2,000,000 \u00d7 0.04 = 80,000 m\u00b2\n- **Total area = 8 hectares of photosynthetic surface**\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Large surface area explains why cassava is efficient at producing tubers (40-50 tonnes/hectare possible with good fertilizer).\n\n## Part 2: Factors Affecting Photosynthesis\n\n### 1. Light Intensity\n- **Too low**: Slow photosynthesis (cloudy days, rainy season)\n- **Optimal**: Bright sunlight (Nigerian dry season)\n- **Too high**: No further increase (light saturation)\n\n### Nigerian Example: Cocoa Under Shade\nIn Ondo State, cocoa trees grow under taller trees (plantain, kola).\n\n**Why?** Young cocoa needs 50-70% shade:\n- Prevents excessive light damage\n- Reduces water loss\n- Optimal photosynthesis at moderate light\n- Mature cocoa tolerates more light\n\n**Economics**: Shade trees = \u20a650,000 investment, but increase cocoa yield by 30%\n\n### 2. Carbon Dioxide Concentration\n- Normal air: 0.04% CO\u2082\n- Optimal: 0.1% CO\u2082 (2.5\u00d7 normal)\n- Limiting factor in closed spaces\n\n### 3. Temperature\n- **Too low** (<10\u00b0C): Enzymes inactive (not common in Nigeria)\n- **Optimal**: 25-35\u00b0C (Nigerian average)\n- **Too high** (>40\u00b0C): Enzymes denature, stomata close\n\n### Worked Example 2: Maize Growth in Kaduna\nIn Kaduna, maize grows in two seasons:\n\n**Dry season irrigation**:\n- Temperature: 30-35\u00b0C (optimal)\n- Light: High intensity (clear skies)\n- Water: Supplemented by irrigation\n- Growth: 3-4 months, 6-8 tonnes/hectare\n\n**Rainy season**:\n- Temperature: 25-30\u00b0C (good)\n- Light: Reduced (cloudy days)\n- Water: Abundant\n- Growth: 4-5 months, 4-6 tonnes/hectare\n\n**Analysis**: Dry season yields more despite needing irrigation because of higher light intensity and temperature.\n\n### 4. Water Availability\n- Required for photosynthesis\n- Maintains turgor pressure\n- Transport medium for nutrients\n- Cooling (transpiration)\n\n## Part 3: Mineral Nutrition\n\n### Macronutrients (Needed in Large Amounts)\n\n#### Nitrogen (N)\n- **Function**: Protein synthesis, chlorophyll, amino acids\n- **Deficiency**: Yellow older leaves, stunted growth\n- **Nigerian source**: Urea (46% N), NPK fertilizer\n- **Cost**: \u20a615,000 per 50kg NPK 20-10-10\n\n#### Phosphorus (P)\n- **Function**: DNA, RNA, ATP (energy), root development\n- **Deficiency**: Dark green/purple leaves, poor root growth\n- **Nigerian source**: Single superphosphate, NPK\n- **Application**: Important for yam, cassava root formation\n\n#### Potassium (K)\n- **Function**: Enzyme activation, stomata operation, disease resistance\n- **Deficiency**: Yellow leaf edges, weak stems\n- **Nigerian source**: Muriate of potash, NPK fertilizer\n\n### Micronutrients (Needed in Small Amounts)\n- Iron (Fe) - Chlorophyll synthesis\n- Magnesium (Mg) - Center of chlorophyll molecule\n- Calcium (Ca) - Cell wall formation\n- Sulfur (S) - Protein synthesis\n\n### Worked Example 3: NPK Fertilizer Application (Benue Cassava Farm)\nA farmer applies NPK 20-10-10 at 300 kg/hectare on 5 hectares.\n\n**Calculate nutrients applied:**\n\n**Solution**:\n- Total NPK = 300 kg/ha \u00d7 5 ha = 1,500 kg\n- **Nitrogen**: 20% of 1,500 = 300 kg pure N\n- **Phosphorus**: 10% of 1,500 = 150 kg pure P\u2082O\u2085\n- **Potassium**: 10% of 1,500 = 150 kg pure K\u2082O\n\n**Cost**: 1,500 kg \u00f7 50 kg/bag = 30 bags\n30 bags \u00d7 \u20a615,000 = **\u20a6450,000 total fertilizer cost**\n\n**Expected yield increase**: \n- Without fertilizer: 15 tonnes/ha\n- With fertilizer: 30-40 tonnes/ha\n- Extra yield: 15-25 tonnes/ha \u00d7 5 ha = 75-125 tonnes\n- @ \u20a650,000/tonne = \u20a63.75-6.25M revenue\n- **Profit after fertilizer**: \u20a63.3-5.8M\n\n**ROI**: 733-1289% return on fertilizer investment!\n\n## Part 4: Nutrient Deficiency in Nigerian Crops\n\n### Nitrogen Deficiency (Most Common)\n**Symptoms**:\n- Yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis)\n- Stunted growth\n- Thin, weak stems\n\n**Nigerian crops affected**: Maize, rice, vegetables\n\n**Solution**: Apply urea (46% N) at 100-200 kg/ha or NPK\n\n**Prevention**: Regular fertilizer application, crop rotation with legumes (beans, cowpea)\n\n### Phosphorus Deficiency\n**Symptoms**:\n- Dark green or purple leaves\n- Poor root development\n- Delayed maturity\n\n**Nigerian crops affected**: Yam, cassava, sweet potato\n\n**Solution**: Single superphosphate at planting\n\n### Iron Deficiency (Chlorosis)\n**Symptoms**:\n- Yellow young leaves (veins stay green)\n- Interveinal chlorosis\n\n**Nigerian crops affected**: Citrus, vegetables in alkaline soils\n\n**Solution**: Foliar spray of iron chelate, adjust soil pH\n\n### Worked Example 4: Diagnosing Maize Deficiency (Kaduna)\nA farmer notices his maize has:\n- Yellow older leaves\n- Thin, weak stems  \n- Slow growth despite adequate water\n\n**Diagnosis**: Nitrogen deficiency\n\n**Treatment**:\n1. Apply urea (46% N) at 150 kg/hectare\n2. Or NPK 20-10-10 at 200 kg/hectare\n3. Split application: Half at 3 weeks, half at 6 weeks\n4. Expect improvement in 1-2 weeks\n\n**Cost**: Urea 150kg @ \u20a620,000/50kg = \u20a660,000/hectare\n\n## Part 5: Transport in Plants\n\n### Xylem (Water & Minerals Up)\n- Dead cells forming tubes\n- Transport from roots to leaves\n- Driven by transpiration pull\n- Contains dissolved minerals (N, P, K, etc.)\n\n### Phloem (Sugars/Food Down)\n- Living cells (sieve tubes)\n- Transport sugars from leaves to storage organs\n- Bidirectional flow\n- Active transport (requires energy)\n\n### Worked Example 5: Water Uptake in Palm Trees (Southeast Nigeria)\nAn oil palm tree in Imo State transpires 40 liters of water daily during dry season.\n\n**Calculate weekly water requirement:**\n\n**Solution**:\n- Daily: 40 liters\n- Weekly: 40 \u00d7 7 = 280 liters = 280 kg water\n- Annual: 40 \u00d7 365 = 14,600 liters \u2248 14.6 tonnes\n\n**Implication**: This water carries dissolved NPK nutrients from soil to leaves. Without adequate soil moisture, nutrient uptake is impaired even with fertilizer application.\n\n**Nigerian farming practice**: Mulching around palm base conserves soil moisture, reduces transpiration losses.\n\n## Part 6: Nigerian Agricultural Applications\n\n### Cassava Farming (40 million tonnes/year)\n- Main producing states: Benue, Cross River, Delta\n- NPK requirement: 300-400 kg/ha (20-10-10)\n- Yield: 15-40 tonnes/ha depending on fertilizer\n- Market price: \u20a650,000/tonne (\u20a6750,000-2M/ha revenue)\n\n### Yam Cultivation (47 million tonnes/year - world's largest)\n- Main states: Benue, Taraba, Enugu, Niger\n- High P requirement for tuber development\n- NPK 12-12-17 at 300 kg/ha\n- Yield: 15-30 tonnes/ha\n- Price: \u20a6200-300/kg (\u20a63-9M/ha revenue)\n\n### Cocoa Production (250,000+ tonnes/year)\n- Main states: Ondo, Cross River, Osun, Edo\n- Shade requirements (50-70% for young trees)\n- NPK 15-15-15 at 200 kg/ha\n- Yield: 400-800 kg/ha dried beans\n- Export price: \u20a61,500-2,000/kg\n\n### Maize Farming (11 million tonnes/year)\n- Main states: Kaduna, Kano, Niger, Taraba\n- N requirement very high (urea 200-300 kg/ha)\n- Yield: 4-8 tonnes/ha\n- Price: \u20a6200/kg (\u20a6800,000-1.6M/ha)\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Photosynthesis equation**: Memorize word and chemical equations\n2. **Limiting factors**: Understand light, CO\u2082, temperature, water\n3. **Deficiency symptoms**: Yellow older leaves = N, Purple = P, Yellow edges = K\n4. **Practical skills**: Test for starch (iodine), test for CO\u2082 (limewater)\n5. **Nigerian examples**: Use local crops in answers (cassava, yam, maize)\n6. **Show calculations**: NPK percentages, fertilizer quantities\n7. **Draw diagrams**: Chloroplast structure, leaf cross-section\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: A 10-hectare cassava farm requires NPK 20-10-10 at 300 kg/ha. Calculate:\n(a) Total fertilizer needed (kg)\n(b) Number of 50kg bags\n(c) Total cost @ \u20a615,000/bag\n(d) Pure nitrogen applied\n\n**Problem 2**: Describe three factors that limit photosynthesis in Nigerian cocoa farms and how farmers overcome each.\n\n**Problem 3**: A maize farmer notices yellow older leaves and stunted growth. Diagnose the deficiency and recommend treatment with calculations.\n\n## Key Equations Summary\n\n- **Photosynthesis**: 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + light \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082\n- **NPK Calculation**: (% N/100) \u00d7 Total fertilizer = Pure N\n- **Fertilizer Cost**: (Total kg \u00f7 50 kg/bag) \u00d7 \u20a615,000/bag\n\n## Nigerian Context Importance\n\nPlant nutrition knowledge is critical for:\n- **Food security** - Feeding 220M+ population\n- **Farmer income** - 70% of rural livelihoods\n- **Export earnings** - Cocoa, cashew, sesame\n- **Industrial raw materials** - Cassava (starch), palm oil\n- **Environmental sustainability** - Proper fertilizer use\n- **Career opportunities** - Agronomy, agribusiness\n\nUnderstanding photosynthesis and mineral nutrition empowers Nigerian farmers to increase yields, improve incomes, and ensure food security!\n",

Understanding nutrition helps explain why a balanced Nigerian diet includes these foods and how our digestive system processes them.\n\n## Part 1: Classes of Food\n\n### 1. Carbohydrates (Energy Foods)\n**Function**: Provide energy (1g = 4 kcal)\n\n**Nigerian sources**:\n- **Rice** (Jollof rice) - 80% carbohydrate\n- **Yam** (Pounded yam, boiled yam) - 28% carbohydrate\n- **Cassava** (Garri, fufu) - 38% carbohydrate\n- **Maize** (Corn, pap/ogi) - 75% carbohydrate\n- **Plantain** (Dodo, boiled) - 32% carbohydrate\n\n**Types**:\n- **Simple sugars**: Glucose, fructose (fruits, honey)\n- **Complex starches**: Rice, yam, cassava\n\n**Daily requirement**: 300-400g (60% of total energy)\n\n### 2. Proteins (Body-building Foods)\n**Function**: Growth, repair, enzymes, antibodies (1g = 4 kcal)\n\n**Nigerian sources**:\n- **Beans** (Moi-moi, Akara) - 22% protein\n- **Fish** (Tilapia, catfish, stockfish) - 20-25% protein\n- **Meat** (Beef, goat, chicken, suya) - 20-25% protein\n- **Eggs** - 13% protein\n- **Groundnuts** - 25% protein\n- **Soy beans** - 36% protein\n\n**Types**:\n- **Complete proteins**: Meat, fish, eggs (contain all essential amino acids)\n- **Incomplete proteins**: Beans, nuts (lack some amino acids)\n\n**Daily requirement**: 50-70g for adults\n\n### 3. Fats and Oils (Energy Storage)\n**Function**: Energy storage, insulation, vitamin absorption (1g = 9 kcal - highest energy)\n\n**Nigerian sources**:\n- **Palm oil** (Red oil) - Used in soups, stews\n- **Groundnut oil** - For frying\n- **Coconut oil** - Traditional cooking\n- **Butter/margarine** - Bread, baking\n- **Fish oil** (from oily fish)\n\n**Daily requirement**: 50-70g (25-30% of total energy)\n\n### 4. Vitamins (Regulatory/Protective)\n**Function**: Regulate body processes, prevent diseases\n\n**Key vitamins in Nigerian diet**:\n- **Vitamin A**: Palm oil (red color = carotene), carrots, green vegetables\n  - Deficiency: Night blindness, dry skin\n- **Vitamin C**: Oranges, tomatoes, peppers\n  - Deficiency: Scurvy (bleeding gums)\n- **Vitamin D**: Fish, eggs, sunshine (Nigeria has plenty!)\n  - Deficiency: Rickets (soft bones in children)\n- **Vitamin B complex**: Yam, rice, beans, meat\n  - Deficiency: Beriberi, anemia\n\n### 5. Minerals (Regulatory/Structural)\n**Function**: Bones, teeth, blood, enzymes\n\n**Key minerals**:\n- **Calcium**: Milk, fish (bones), vegetables\n  - Function: Strong bones and teeth\n- **Iron**: Meat, beans, green vegetables\n  - Function: Hemoglobin (carries oxygen)\n  - Deficiency: Anemia (common in Nigeria)\n- **Iodine**: Iodized salt, fish\n  - Function: Thyroid hormone\n  - Deficiency: Goiter (swollen neck)\n\n### 6. Water\n**Function**: Transport, temperature regulation, chemical reactions\n\n**Daily requirement**: 2-3 liters (8-10 glasses)\n\n**Nigerian context**: Pure water sachets (\u20a610 each), boreholes, treated tap water\n\n### 7. Fiber (Roughage)\n**Function**: Aids digestion, prevents constipation\n\n**Nigerian sources**: Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans\n\n## Part 2: Balanced Diet - The Nigerian Approach\n\n### Traditional 6-3-1 Method\nNigerian nutritionists recommend:\n- **6 portions**: Carbohydrates (Rice, yam, garri, etc.)\n- **3 portions**: Proteins (Fish, meat, beans)\n- **1 portion**: Vegetables/fruits\n\n### Sample Balanced Nigerian Meals\n\n#### Breakfast (\u20a6500-800)\n- Bread + Akara + Pap\n- OR Boiled yam + egg sauce\n- OR Plantain + beans\n\n#### Lunch/Dinner (\u20a61,200-2,000)\n- **Main**: Jollof rice with chicken/fish\n- **Soup option**: Egusi soup + pounded yam + beef\n- **Swallow option**: Eba + vegetable soup + fish\n- **Side**: Salad, fruit\n\n**Daily cost for balanced diet in Lagos**: \u20a61,500-2,500\n\n### Worked Example 1: Calculating Daily Nutrition Needs\nA 70kg adult male in Lagos needs:\n- Energy: 2,500 kcal/day\n- Protein: 56g/day (0.8g per kg body weight)\n- Fat: 70g/day\n\n**Sample menu**:\n- **Breakfast**: Bread (200 kcal) + Akara (150 kcal) + Pap (100 kcal) = 450 kcal, 12g protein\n- **Lunch**: Jollof rice (400 kcal) + Chicken (200 kcal) + Salad (50 kcal) = 650 kcal, 25g protein\n- **Dinner**: Pounded yam (500 kcal) + Egusi soup (300 kcal) + Fish (150 kcal) = 950 kcal, 30g protein\n- **Snacks**: Fruits, nuts (400 kcal), 8g protein\n\n**Total**: 2,450 kcal, 75g protein \u2705 **Meets requirements**\n\n## Part 3: Human Digestive System\n\n### Organs and Functions\n\n#### 1. Mouth (Oral Cavity)\n**Process**: Mechanical digestion (chewing), chemical digestion (saliva)\n- **Teeth**: Break food into smaller pieces\n- **Saliva**: Contains amylase enzyme\n- **Reaction**: Starch \u2192 Maltose (sugar)\n\n**Nigerian example**: Chewing pounded yam requires strong molars; saliva begins breaking down starch immediately.\n\n#### 2. Esophagus (Food Pipe)\n**Process**: Peristalsis (wave-like muscle contractions push food down)\n- Length: ~25 cm\n- Time: 10-15 seconds for food to reach stomach\n\n#### 3. Stomach\n**Process**: Mechanical churning + chemical digestion\n- **Gastric juice**: Contains HCl (pH 2) + pepsin enzyme\n- **Reaction**: Proteins \u2192 Peptides\n- **Time**: Food stays 2-4 hours\n\n**Nigerian example**: After eating suya (protein), pepsin breaks down meat proteins. Acidic environment kills bacteria.\n\n#### 4. Small Intestine (6-7 meters long)\n**Three parts**: Duodenum, Jejunum, Ileum\n\n**Duodenum** (first 25cm):\n- **Bile** (from liver): Emulsifies fats\n- **Pancreatic juice**: Contains lipase, amylase, trypsin\n- **Reactions**:\n  - Fats \u2192 Fatty acids + Glycerol (lipase)\n  - Starch \u2192 Maltose \u2192 Glucose (amylase)\n  - Proteins \u2192 Amino acids (trypsin)\n\n**Jejunum & Ileum**:\n- **Absorption**: Nutrients absorbed through villi into bloodstream\n- **Surface area**: Increased by millions of villi (finger-like projections)\n\n**Nigerian example**: After eating Egusi soup (high fat content), bile emulsifies the palm oil into tiny droplets, then lipase breaks them down for absorption.\n\n#### 5. Large Intestine (Colon)\n**Process**: Water reabsorption, formation of feces\n- Length: 1.5 meters\n- **Time**: 12-24 hours\n- **Absorption**: Water, vitamins\n\n**Nigerian context**: Adequate fiber (from vegetables) prevents constipation by retaining water in colon.\n\n#### 6. Rectum and Anus\n**Process**: Storage and elimination of feces (egestion)\n\n### Worked Example 2: Digestion Timeline for Nigerian Meal\nA person eats Jollof rice + chicken at 2:00 PM.\n\n**Timeline**:\n- **2:00 PM**: Mouth - Chewing, saliva begins starch digestion\n- **2:01 PM**: Swallowing, esophagus transport (15 seconds)\n- **2:01-6:00 PM**: Stomach - Protein digestion (4 hours)\n- **6:00-8:00 PM**: Small intestine - Complete digestion and absorption (2 hours)\n- **8:00 PM-10:00 AM** (next day): Large intestine - Water absorption (14 hours)\n- **10:00 AM**: Egestion (feces)\n\n**Total time**: Mouth to anus = ~20 hours\n\n## Part 4: Absorption and Assimilation\n\n### Villi Structure (Small Intestine)\n- **Shape**: Finger-like projections\n- **Function**: Increase surface area for absorption\n- **Structure**:\n  - Thin wall (one cell thick)\n  - Rich blood supply (capillaries)\n  - Lacteal (for fat absorption)\n\n### What Gets Absorbed Where\n\n**Small intestine**:\n- Glucose \u2192 Blood \u2192 Liver \u2192 Body cells\n- Amino acids \u2192 Blood \u2192 Liver \u2192 Body cells\n- Fatty acids + Glycerol \u2192 Lymph \u2192 Blood\n- Vitamins, minerals \u2192 Blood\n\n**Large intestine**:\n- Water \u2192 Blood\n- Vitamins (K, B12 produced by bacteria) \u2192 Blood\n\n### Assimilation\nNutrients used by body cells:\n- **Glucose**: Respiration for energy (or stored as glycogen)\n- **Amino acids**: Build new proteins (muscles, enzymes)\n- **Fatty acids**: Energy storage (or cell membranes)\n\n## Part 5: Food Tests (WAEC Practicals)\n\n### Test for Starch (Iodine Test)\n- **Reagent**: Iodine solution (brown)\n- **Positive result**: Blue-black color\n- **Nigerian foods**: Yam, cassava, rice, maize\n\n**Procedure**:\n1. Grind food sample\n2. Add 2-3 drops iodine solution\n3. Observe color change\n\n### Test for Reducing Sugars (Benedict's Test)\n- **Reagent**: Benedict's solution (blue)\n- **Method**: Heat in water bath\n- **Positive result**: Green \u2192 Yellow \u2192 Orange \u2192 Brick-red (depending on sugar concentration)\n- **Nigerian foods**: Fruits, honey\n\n### Test for Proteins (Biuret Test)\n- **Reagents**: NaOH + Copper sulfate\n- **Positive result**: Purple/violet color\n- **Nigerian foods**: Beans, fish, meat, eggs\n\n### Test for Fats (Grease Spot Test)\n- **Method**: Rub food on filter paper, hold against light\n- **Positive result**: Translucent (greasy) spot\n- **Nigerian foods**: Palm oil, groundnut oil, butter\n\n### Worked Example 3: Testing Nigerian Foods\nA student tests four foods: Garri, groundnut, orange juice, fish.\n\n**Results**:\n| Food | Iodine | Benedict's | Biuret | Grease Spot |\n|------|--------|------------|--------|-------------|\n| Garri | Blue-black | Negative | Negative | Negative |\n| Groundnut | Negative | Negative | Purple | Translucent |\n| Orange juice | Negative | Orange | Negative | Negative |\n| Fish | Negative | Negative | Purple | Slight translucent |\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- Garri: Rich in starch\n- Groundnut: Contains protein and fat\n- Orange juice: Contains reducing sugars (fructose, glucose)\n- Fish: Contains protein and some fat\n\n## Part 6: Malnutrition in Nigerian Context\n\n### Protein-Energy Malnutrition\n\n#### Kwashiorkor\n**Cause**: Severe protein deficiency (child weaned to starchy diet)\n**Symptoms**:\n- Swollen belly (fluid retention)\n- Thin limbs\n- Skin lesions\n- Hair discoloration (orange/red)\n\n**Nigerian context**: Common in rural areas where children eat mostly garri/pap with little protein\n\n**Prevention**: Include beans, fish, eggs in children's diet\n\n#### Marasmus\n**Cause**: Severe calorie and protein deficiency\n**Symptoms**:\n- Extreme thinness\n- Wrinkled skin\n- No fat or muscle\n\n**Prevention**: Adequate food quantity and quality\n\n### Vitamin Deficiencies\n\n#### Vitamin A Deficiency\n**Symptoms**: Night blindness, dry eyes\n**Nigerian prevention**: Red palm oil (rich in carotene), carrots\n\n#### Vitamin C Deficiency (Scurvy)\n**Symptoms**: Bleeding gums, slow wound healing\n**Nigerian prevention**: Oranges (\u20a650-100 each), tomatoes, peppers\n\n#### Iron Deficiency (Anemia)\n**Symptoms**: Fatigue, pale skin, dizziness\n**Common in**: Pregnant women, children\n**Nigerian prevention**: Red meat, beans, green vegetables, iron supplements\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Food classes**: Memorize all 7 classes and Nigerian examples\n2. **Digestive system**: Draw and label diagram accurately\n3. **Enzymes**: Know where each enzyme works (amylase, pepsin, lipase, trypsin)\n4. **Food tests**: Learn all 4 tests, reagents, and results\n5. **Balanced diet**: Use Nigerian foods in explanations\n6. **Deficiency diseases**: Link to symptoms and prevention\n7. **Show calculations**: Energy content, daily requirements\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: Plan a balanced Nigerian meal for a family of 4 with \u20a65,000 budget.
