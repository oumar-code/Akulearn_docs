      "content": "\n# Quadratic Equations\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this guide, you should be able to:\n- Define quadratic equations\n- Solve quadratic equations using different methods\n- Apply quadratic equations to real-world problems\n\n## What is a Quadratic Equation?\n\nA quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2, with the general form:\n**ax² + bx + c = 0**\n\nWhere:\n- **a** ≠ 0 (coefficient of x²)\n- **b** = coefficient of x\n- **c** = constant term\n\n### Examples of Quadratic Equations:\n- x² + 5x + 6 = 0\n- 2x² - 7x + 3 = 0\n- x² = 10\n\n## Methods of Solving Quadratic Equations\n\n### 1. Factorization Method\nExpress the quadratic as a product of two binomials.\n\n**Example:** Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0\n- Find factors of 6 that add to 5: 2 and 3\n- (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0\n- x = -2 or x = -3\n\n### 2. Quadratic Formula\nFor ax² + bx + c = 0, the solutions are:\n**x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a**\n\n**Example:** Solve x² - 5x + 6 = 0\n- a = 1, b = -5, c = 6\n- x = [5 ± √(25 - 24)] / 2\n- x = [5 ± √1] / 2\n- x = [5 ± 1] / 2\n- x = 3 or x = 2\n\n### 3. Completing the Square\nRewrite the equation in the form (x + h)² = k\n\n**Example:** Solve x² + 6x + 5 = 0\n- x² + 6x = -5\n- x² + 6x + 9 = -5 + 9\n- (x + 3)² = 4\n- x + 3 = ±2\n- x = -3 ± 2\n- x = -1 or x = -5\n\n## Applications of Quadratic Equations\n\n### 1. Projectile Motion\nThe height of a projectile is given by: h = -16t² + v₀t + h₀\n\n### 2. Area Problems\nFinding dimensions when area is given.\n\n### 3. Revenue Optimization\nFinding maximum profit: Revenue = price × quantity\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n1. **Forgetting the ± sign** in quadratic formula\n2. **Incorrect discriminant calculation**\n3. **Not checking solutions** by substitution\n4. **Division by zero** (a ≠ 0)\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n1. Solve: x² - 7x + 12 = 0\n2. Solve: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0\n3. Find the roots: x² - 4x - 5 = 0\n\n## Exam Tips\n\n- Always show your working clearly\n- Check your answers by substitution\n- Use the most efficient method for each problem\n- Practice different types of quadratic equations\n            ",
