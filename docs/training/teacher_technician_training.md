# Teacher & Technician Training — Aku Platform (Pilot)

This document outlines training tracks, learning objectives, and quick-reference materials for teachers and local technicians participating in the Gusau pilot.

## Teacher Track (Primary audience: secondary school teachers)
Duration: 2 days (in-person)

Learning objectives:
- Accessing Aku Learn and navigating curriculum content
- Running classroom activities and assigning practice exercises
- Collecting student progress and basic reporting
- Troubleshooting basic user/device connection issues

Day 1: Introduction & Platform Basics
- Overview of Aku Learn and pilot goals
- Signing in, class management, searching content
- Running a sample lesson and quiz

Day 2: Classroom Integration & Feedback
- Creating assignments and using AI-generated practice
- Reviewing student progress and recommendations
- Collecting classroom feedback and reporting issues

Quick Reference (teacher) — one page (short):
- URL/SSID: AkuNetwork-<school>
- Admin login: provided in setup
- Common actions: Start lesson, run quiz, view reports
- Support contact: local technician phone

## Technician Track (Primary audience: local installers and support)
Duration: 2 days (hands-on)

Learning objectives:
- Mechanical installation (mounting, grounding, theft mitigation)
- Solar system basics: PV connection, battery check, fuse replacement
- Basic electronics: checking PMU telemetry, replacing fuses, swapping modules
- Network commissioning: Wi‑Fi SSID, local DHCP, SIP registration, content sync
- Logging and escalation (how to collect logs and open tickets)

Day 1: Hardware & Power
- Site survey reading, solar orientation, mounting best-practices
- Wiring: battery, fuses, PV input, earthing
- Safety checklist and checklist sign-off

Day 2: Commissioning & Remote Ops
- Power-on tests, INA telemetry checks, verify rails
- Boot and network checks, content sync test, SIP registration
- Firmware update process and rollback

Troubleshooting quick flow (technician):
1) Edge unresponsive — check battery voltage → check fuse → reboot → check logs → escalate
2) Low solar charge — check PV open-circuit voltage, shading, panel mount

Materials to provide
- Trainer slides (pptx/markdown)
- One-page teacher card (printable)
- Technician field checklist (printable)
