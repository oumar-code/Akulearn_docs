# Akulearn Project Phase 1 Roadmap

## Overall Phase 1 Goal

Launch a robust MVP (Mobile App & Projector System) within 18 months, validate the solution in real-world settings, and lay the foundation for scalable, impactful EdTech across Nigeria. Key objectives include:

- Deliver core learning experiences to both connected and underserved communities
- Integrate basic AI for personalized learning
- Establish operational, support, and feedback mechanisms

## Methodologies

- **Agile (Scrum):** Iterative development with 2-week sprints, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives
- **Cross-Functional Squads:** Teams organized by feature (e.g., Authentication, Content, Mobile App), each with backend, frontend, and QA members
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying code
- **Shift-Left QA:** Testers involved from the start, with automated and manual testing throughout

## Workstreams

- **Mobile App Development:** User onboarding, curriculum browsing, video playback, quizzes, progress tracking
- **Projector OS Development:** Lesson playback, attendance, local storage, sync mechanism
- **Admin Portal:** User management, content upload, projector registration
- **Backend & API:** Authentication, content delivery, user data storage
- **AI Integration:** Personalized recommendations, basic ML model
- **Hardware Prototyping:** Alpha projector units, internal testing
- **Pilot Program:** Community selection, facilitator recruitment, deployment
- **Testing & QA:** System, integration, performance, security
- **Feedback & Refinement:** Gather user feedback, iterate on features

## Sprint-by-Sprint Breakdown

### Months 1-3: Project Planning & Setup

- Finalize PRD, FSD, TRD, and project plan
- Hire core team
- Set up cloud infrastructure and DevOps pipelines
- Establish initial backlog and sprint cadence

### Months 4-9: Core MVP Development

- **Mobile App:** Build onboarding, curriculum browse, video playback, quizzes, progress tracking
- **Projector OS:** Develop lesson playback, manual attendance, local storage, sync
- **Admin Portal:** Implement user management, content upload, projector registration
- **Backend & API:** Core authentication, content delivery, user data storage

### Months 10-12: AI & Hardware Prototyping

- Integrate basic AI for personalized content recommendations
- Produce and test alpha projector units
- Plan pilot program, select communities, recruit facilitators

### Months 13-18: Testing, Pilot Deployment & Launch

- Comprehensive internal and alpha/beta testing (system, integration, performance, security)
- Deploy MVP projector units to pilot communities
- Gather facilitator and student feedback
- Soft launch mobile app, collect user feedback
- Integrate initial AI tutor (text-based)
- Refine features based on pilot feedback

## Key Milestones

- **M1.1 (Month 3):** Core team and infrastructure ready
- **M1.2 (Month 9):** Mobile app & projector MVP feature freeze
- **M1.3 (Month 12):** Initial AI personalization & projector alpha hardware ready
- **M1.4 (Month 18):** Pilot program completion & mobile app public launch (Android first)

## Success Criteria

- MVP deployed and validated in real-world settings
- Positive feedback from pilot communities and users
- Foundational AI features operational
- Scalable infrastructure and team processes established

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion of Phase 1, Akulearn will transition to growth and scaling, expanding features, user base, and operational reach across Nigeria and beyond.
