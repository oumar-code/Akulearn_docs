# Zamfara Pilot Plan — Gusau (10 Edge Hubs)

## Purpose
This document describes the scope, objectives, timeline, success criteria and owners for the Gusau pilot of the Aku Platform (Aku Learn + Edge Hubs). The pilot validates the education-first deployment model, hardware reliability, local content, and community uptake.

## Objectives
- Validate Aku Learn content and teacher workflows in classroom settings
- Validate Edge Hub hardware (PMU, solar, RF) in Zamfara environmental conditions
- Demonstrate community utility (local calls, limited internet) and measure demand
- Collect operational lessons to inform LGA rollouts and Super Hub deployment

## Scope
- 10 Edge Hubs deployed across 10 selected secondary schools in Gusau
- Preloaded Aku Learn content for secondary curriculum (core subjects)
- Local VoIP and cache-enabled content delivery
- Teacher training and technician support for 3 months

## Timeline (months)
- Week -8 to -1: Stakeholder alignment, procurement of kits, site survey scheduling
- Week 0–2: Site surveys and kit staging
- Week 2–6: Install 10 Edge Hubs (2–3 installs/week)
- Week 6–14: Teacher onboarding, community outreach, stabilize operations
- Week 14–26: Data collection, iterative improvements, readiness review for LGA scale

## Success Criteria (Go/No-Go)
- Edge Hub uptime >= 95% over a 30-day window (excluding scheduled maintenance)
- At least 60% of target teachers actively using Aku Learn weekly by Week 10
- Minimum 300 unique students accessing Aku Learn weekly across pilot schools by Week 12
- Local call intra-Aku success rate >= 95%; cache hit ratio >= 60% for preloaded content

## Key Roles & Owners
- Project Lead: overall delivery and liaison with Ministry of Education
- Deployment Lead: site surveys, staging, installations
- Procurement: parts, spares, supplier coordination
- Training Lead: teacher and technician curricula
- Monitoring Lead: telemetry, dashboards, KPIs

## Reporting & Communication
- Weekly operational stand-up reports (Deployment Lead)
- Biweekly stakeholder progress reports (Project Lead)
- Incident escalation: immediate to Project Lead, 24-hour response SLA for critical failures

## Risk & Mitigations (summary)
- Solar underperformance: overspec PV and battery margin; pre-installation insolation checks
- Hardware failure: maintain local spares and rapid replacement plan
- Teacher adoption low: in-class coaching and incentives

## Next steps
1. Finalize 10 school list and schedule site surveys
2. Place prototype procurement order and reserve spares
3. Produce site-survey templates and training materials
