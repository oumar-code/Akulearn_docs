# Community Engagement & Sustainability Plan — Zamfara Pilot

## Objective
Engage local communities to ensure adoption, sustainability and local ownership of Aku services. Build partnerships that support operations, maintenance and local revenue generation.

## Principles
- Community-first: schools act as anchors and focal points for engagement
- Local ownership: train and empower local technicians and champions
- Financial sustainability: create affordable pricing and local revenue channels

## Outreach Activities
- School Launch Events: host a community event per school at installation to demonstrate Aku Learn and network services.
- Parent/Teacher Forums: present pilot benefits, privacy safeguards, and consent forms for student data.
- Community Ambassadors: recruit and train 2 local ambassadors per LGA to promote services and report issues.

## Revenue & Sustainability Models
- Free core education services: Aku Learn access is free for schools and students while connected to Edge Hubs.
- Micro-payments for community access: small fees for wider internet access or premium content (managed via vouchers or eSIM bundles).
- Local resellers: enable local entrepreneurs to run Aku Wi‑Fi access points (revenue share model).
- Institutional subscriptions: schools or NGOs can buy enhanced services (analytics, printing, backup) to support recurring revenue.

## Maintenance & Local Capacity
- Local Technician Network: formalize the technician tracks (Level 1–3) and maintain a directory with contact details.
- Spare parts pool: maintain a small inventory in Gusau for rapid replacement.
- Monthly community maintenance days: scheduled check-ups and minor repairs with small participation fees where appropriate.

## Governance & Feedback
- School Governance Board: each school forms a small committee (teachers + parent rep) to approve usage policies.
- Feedback Loop: weekly teacher feedback during pilot; monthly community surveys to adapt services and pricing.

## Metrics to Track
- Number of community users per Edge Hub
- Revenue generated from community services
- Average time to repair (MTTR) for hardware faults
- Satisfaction scores from teachers and community surveys

## Risks & Mitigations
- Resistance to paid service: emphasize free educational tier, consider sponsorships for low-income families
- Misuse of services: enforce acceptable use policy and local governance

## Next steps
1. Draft event template for school launches
2. Create ambassador recruitment & stipend plan
3. Setup local reseller contract template
