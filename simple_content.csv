Introduction to Linear Equations,Mathematics,Algebra,study_guide,intermediate,WAEC,"# Linear Equations\n\nA linear equation is an equation that makes a straight line when graphed. General form: ax + b = c\n\n## Solving Methods\n1. Addition/Subtraction: Perform same operation on both sides\n2. Multiplication/Division: Isolate the variable\n\n## Example\nx + 5 = 12\nx = 12 - 5\nx = 7",15,basic_algebra,waec_math_2020_q1,linear_equations,algebra,Mathematics Expert
