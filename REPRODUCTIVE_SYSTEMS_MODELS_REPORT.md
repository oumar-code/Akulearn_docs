## Reproductive Biology Principles

### 1. Human Male Reproduction
- **Spermatogenesis:** Continuous process from puberty onward
- **Testosterone Regulation:** Feedback loop with pituitary gland
- **Sperm Structure:** Head (nucleus), midpiece (mitochondria), flagella (movement)
- **Ejaculation Reflex:** Involuntary and voluntary components

### 2. Human Female Reproduction
- **Oogenesis:** Begins before birth, arrests at puberty
- **Ovulation:** Release of single egg monthly
- **Estrogen & Progesterone:** Regulate menstrual cycle and pregnancy
- **Fertility Window:** 12-24 hours after ovulation

### 3. Plant Reproduction
- **Pollination:** Transfer of pollen from anther to stigma
- **Self-pollination:** Flower fertilizes itself
- **Cross-pollination:** Between different flowers/plants
- **Pollen Tube:** Delivers sperm nuclei to ovule

### 4. Human Development
- **Conception:** Sperm + egg = zygote
- **Implantation:** Blastocyst attaches to uterine wall
- **Organ Formation:** Embryonic period (weeks 2-8)
- **Fetal Period:** Growth and maturation (weeks 9-40)

### 5. Hormonal Regulation
- **FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone):** Stimulates follicle growth and sperm production
- **LH (Luteinizing Hormone):** Triggers ovulation and testosterone production
- **Estrogen:** Builds endometrium, develops secondary sexual characteristics
- **Progesterone:** Maintains pregnancy, stabilizes endometrium

### 6. Meiosis vs. Mitosis
- **Meiosis:** Reduces chromosome number (2n → n), creates genetic variation
- **Mitosis:** Maintains chromosome number, produces identical cells
- **Gamete Formation:** Uses meiosis to ensure proper chromosome numbers
