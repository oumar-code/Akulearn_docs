## Risk Mitigation

### **Risk 1: Low Social Media Engagement**
**Cause**: Limited existing audience (cold launch)  
**Mitigation**:
- Share posts in 3-5 Slack/Discord communities (Kaggle, NLP, EdTech)
- DM 20 relevant LinkedIn connections asking for share
- Engage on other technical posts (comment, like, share)

### **Risk 2: Calendly Booking No-Shows**
**Cause**: Prospects book but don't attend  
**Mitigation**:
- Confirmation email 24 hours before
- 1-hour reminder email with Zoom link
- Follow-up "reschedule" email if no-show occurs

### **Risk 3: Case Studies Don't Convert Leads**
**Cause**: Not addressing prospect pain points  
**Mitigation**:
- Track which case study gets most clicks
- A/B test different CTAs (Calendly vs email inquiry vs WhatsApp)
- Add customer testimonial/quote to highest-engagement case study

### **Risk 4: Kaggle Notebook Too Complex**
**Cause**: Unclear baseline approach or missing dependencies  
**Mitigation**:
- Test notebook locally before posting
- Include clear setup instructions
- Link to GitHub issues for questions

→ 1,000 impressions, 5-10 clicks, 2-3 bookings scheduled

**Day 10-14**: Post consulting calls, testimonials
→ Second booking likely converts to proposal

**Day 21-30**: Momentum builds, referrals appear
→ 1-2 deals closed, 2-3 new Kaggle collaborators, 100+ new followers

**Expected Outcome**: ₦500k-₦1M in new consulting revenue, expanded personal network, proven portfolio for next fundraise

## Questions & Customizations

**Q: Do I need to create the website immediately?**  
A: No. Start with social + Calendly. Website builds brand presence but isn't critical for early revenue.

**Q: How often should I post?**  
A: Week 1: Daily (7 days). Week 2+: 2-3x/week (Tue, Thu, Sun). Adjust based on engagement.

**Q: Can I sell case studies or use them for other companies?**  
A: They're your IP. Use them as sales collateral. Don't post them on other sites without permission.

**Q: What if I don't get Kaggle submissions?**  
A: That's fine. Notebook serves dual purpose: (1) portfolio piece, (2) competition entry. If entry doesn't place, notebook still impresses employers/clients.

**Q: How do I handle multiple inquiries at once?**  
A: Track in a simple spreadsheet (Google Sheets): name, date, interest area, follow-up date, deal stage. Use templates to respond quickly.
