Subject: Inquiry — Jetson-compatible compute module procurement and dev kits

Hello NVIDIA sales/partner team,

We are evaluating Jetson modules (Orin Nano / Orin NX / Jetson family) for the Aku Platform Edge Alpha. Could you provide:

- Current availability for Orin Nano / Orin NX modules and dev kits
- Pricing for low-volume orders (5–20 modules) and dev kits
- Recommended thermal and carrier board options for field-deployable use
- Any partner distributors in the ECOWAS region

We can share power/thermal envelope and preliminary BOM upon request.

Best,
[Your Name]
