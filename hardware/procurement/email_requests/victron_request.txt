Subject: Inquiry — Solar / MPPT hardware and chargers for Edge Alpha

Hello Victron / solar hardware team,

We are designing a prototype Edge Alpha device with small solar input and need MPPT-capable charge controllers suitable for 12V LiFePO4 battery packs (low-to-mid-power, up to ~200W). Please advise recommended MPPT modules, pricing for prototype quantities, and integration notes.

Key requirements:
- Input: small PV panels (12–36V typical)
- Output: charge LiFePO4 12V battery banks
- Remote telemetry option preferred

Thanks,
[Your Name]
