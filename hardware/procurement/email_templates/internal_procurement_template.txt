Subject: Procurement Request — Aku Platform Edge Alpha Parts (RFQ attached)

Team,

Attached is the RFQ/BOM for the Aku Platform Edge Alpha prototype. Please assist with: obtaining quotes from preferred distributors (Digi-Key, Mouser, Arrow, Avnet), checking regional availability, and starting purchase orders for dev kits and long-lead items.

Key priorities:
- Jetson Orin Nano Dev Kit (order 1)
- Jetson Orin Nano Module (order 1 or place on hold depending on dev kit progress)
- Cellular modem (EG25-G) — confirm eSIM variant and regional bands
- LiFePO4 battery pack (12.8V, 20Ah) with BMS (UN38.3 docs required)

Please update the RFQ CSV with supplier quotes, lead times, and contact info. Let me know if any items have extended lead times (>8 weeks) so we can identify alternates.

Thanks,

[Your Name]
Aku Platform Procurement
