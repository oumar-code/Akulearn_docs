This folder is a placeholder for the KiCad project files for the Edge Hub alpha.

Recommended project name: edge-alpha
Recommended first sheets: pmu.sch, compute_carrier.sch, rf_frontend.sch, sensors.sch

Create the KiCad project locally and push the project files to a hardware-specific branch once the schematic is mature.
