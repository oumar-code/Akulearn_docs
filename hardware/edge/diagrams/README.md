# Edge diagrams

This folder contains Mermaid source files for Edge Hub block diagrams and power management diagrams. The repository's CI renders `.mmd` files into SVG/PNG assets for documentation.

Files:
- `edge_system_block.mmd` - high-level system block diagram.
- `pmu_block.mmd` - power management block diagram.
- `network_block.mmd` - connectivity and integration block diagram.

Render locally with a Mermaid tool or rely on the repo's `.github/workflows/render-mermaid.yml` to generate artifacts on push.
