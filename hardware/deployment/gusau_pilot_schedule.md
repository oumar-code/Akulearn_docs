Week-by-week activities (detailed)

Weeks 0–4: Preparation & Procurement
- Week 0: Kickoff meeting with Zamfara Ministry of Education, security/regulatory review, appoint local contacts. (Program Manager)
- Week 1: Finalize BOM and issue RFQs to suppliers; confirm shipping and lead-times. (Procurement)
- Week 2: Prepare training materials and site-survey forms; recruit local installers/technicians. (Training Lead + Deployment Lead)
- Week 3: Receive first prototype kits; run bench tests (power, Wi‑Fi AP, VoIP registration, content sync). (Hardware Lead)
- Week 4: Pack staging kits and plan logistics—transport, tools, spare parts. (Logistics)

Weeks 5–8: Site surveys & staging
- Week 5: Conduct fast site surveys for top 15 candidate schools (target: select final 10). Collect GPS, photos, mounting options. (Deployment Teams)
- Week 6: Confirm final 10 schools, refine antenna placement plans and solar sizing. (Deployment Lead)
- Week 7: Stage kits in Gusau warehouse; pre-load Aku Learn content for each school. (Field Ops)
- Week 8: Technician refresher training and dry-run installs at 1 pilot site. (Training + Hardware)

Weeks 9–12: Installations
- Week 9: Install Edge Hubs at sites 1–4 (2–3 teams working in parallel). Each site: mount, wire, solar, battery, radio alignment. (Field Ops)
- Week 10: Install sites 5–7. Perform daily check-ins and triage. (Field Ops)
- Week 11: Install sites 8–10. Begin remote monitoring feed to Super Hub. (Field Ops)
- Week 12: Buffer week — fix emergent problems, replace faulty parts, ensure all sites stable. (Field Ops / Procurement)

Weeks 13–16: Commissioning & Onboarding
- Week 13: Commission each site: verify Wi‑Fi SSID, local caching, INA telemetry, SIP registration. (Hardware Lead)
- Week 14: Teacher onboarding (2 days per school or cluster) + distribute quick-reference cards. (Training Lead)
- Week 15: Community launch events at a subset of schools; collect registrations for eSIM pilot (if ready). (Community Lead)
- Week 16: First-week operational report: uptime, teacher signups, student usage. (Monitoring)

Weeks 17–24: Monitoring, iteration & evaluation
- Week 17–20: Monitor KPIs; respond to field issues; iterate software/UX issues in Aku Learn.
- Week 21: Mid-pilot review (2 weeks before 30-day evaluation). Present preliminary findings to stakeholders.
- Week 22–24: 30-day measurement window and final pilot evaluation; produce Go/No-Go recommendations. (Project Lead)

Key Deliverables
- Site survey CSVs (one per school) — Deployment Lead
- Bench test report for prototype kits — Hardware Lead
- Installation completion reports with photos and GPS — Field Ops
- Teacher training attendance and feedback form results — Training Lead
- Monitoring dashboard and weekly status reports — Monitoring Lead

Go/No-Go criteria (sample)
- Pilot passes if: average Edge Hub uptime >=95% across sites for 30 days, active teacher usage >=60% (weekly), and cache hit ratio >=40% for Aku Learn content.
- If pilot fails to meet 2 or more major criteria, pause LGA rollout and execute corrective action plan.

Notes
- Keep at least 2 spare kits and a rotating stock of critical spares in Gusau during installation.
- Use local hires where possible for installation teams to build capacity and reduce travel costs.
