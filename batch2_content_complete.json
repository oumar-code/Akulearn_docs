In Nigeria, trigonometry has practical applications in surveying (Abuja city planning), telecommunications (MTN cell tower positioning), civil engineering (Niger Bridge construction), and navigation (River Niger shipping routes).\n\n## Part 1: Trigonometric Ratios (SOHCAHTOA)\n\n### The Foundation\n\nFor a right-angled triangle with angle \u03b8:\n\n**SOH**: sin \u03b8 = Opposite/Hypotenuse\n**CAH**: cos \u03b8 = Adjacent/Hypotenuse  \n**TOA**: tan \u03b8 = Opposite/Adjacent\n\n### Nigerian Example: MTN Cell Tower Height\n\n**Problem**: An MTN engineer in Lagos stands 50 meters from the base of a cell tower. The angle of elevation to the top is 67\u00b0. Find the tower's height.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\ntan 67\u00b0 = height/50\nheight = 50 \u00d7 tan 67\u00b0\nheight = 50 \u00d7 2.356\nheight \u2248 117.8 meters\n```\n\n**Answer**: The MTN tower is approximately 118 meters tall.\n\n**WAEC Tip**: Always draw a diagram first! Label the known values and the unknown you're solving for.\n\n## Part 2: Angles of Elevation and Depression\n\n### Nigerian Example: Aso Rock Measurement\n\n**Problem**: From a point 200 meters from the base of Aso Rock in Abuja, the angle of elevation to the peak is 52\u00b0. Calculate the height of the rock formation.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\ntan 52\u00b0 = height/200\nheight = 200 \u00d7 tan 52\u00b0\nheight = 200 \u00d7 1.280\nheight \u2248 256 meters\n```\n\n**Answer**: Aso Rock is approximately 256 meters high.\n\n### Angle of Depression Example: Kainji Dam Observation\n\n**Problem**: An engineer at the top of Kainji Dam (80 meters high) observes a boat on the Niger River. The angle of depression is 35\u00b0. How far is the boat from the base of the dam?\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nAngle of depression = Angle of elevation (alternate angles)\ntan 35\u00b0 = 80/distance\ndistance = 80/tan 35\u00b0\ndistance = 80/0.700\ndistance \u2248 114.3 meters\n```\n\n**Answer**: The boat is approximately 114 meters from the dam.\n\n## Part 3: Bearings and Navigation\n\n### Understanding Bearings\n\n- Bearings are measured clockwise from North (000\u00b0)\n- Written as three-figure bearings: 045\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 270\u00b0\n- Back bearings differ by 180\u00b0\n\n### Nigerian Example: Navigation on River Niger\n\n**Problem**: A cargo ship travels from Lokoja to Baro on the Niger River. It sails 80 km on a bearing of 055\u00b0, then 60 km on a bearing of 125\u00b0. Find the direct distance and bearing from Lokoja to its final position.\n\n**Solution** (Using Cosine Rule):\n```\nAngle between paths = 125\u00b0 - 055\u00b0 = 70\u00b0\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos C\nc\u00b2 = 80\u00b2 + 60\u00b2 - 2(80)(60) cos 70\u00b0\nc\u00b2 = 6400 + 3600 - 9600(0.342)\nc\u00b2 = 10000 - 3283\nc\u00b2 = 6717\nc \u2248 82 km\n\nUsing Sine Rule for bearing:\nsin A/60 = sin 70\u00b0/82\nsin A = (60 \u00d7 0.940)/82\nsin A = 0.688\nA \u2248 43.4\u00b0\n\nFinal bearing = 55\u00b0 + 43.4\u00b0 \u2248 098\u00b0\n```\n\n**Answer**: The ship is 82 km from Lokoja on a bearing of 098\u00b0.\n\n## Part 4: Sine Rule\n\n**Formula**: a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C\n\n### Nigerian Example: Surveying Obudu Cattle Ranch\n\n**Problem**: A surveyor at Obudu Cattle Ranch needs to measure the distance across a valley. From point A, the distance to point B is 250 meters. The angle at A is 75\u00b0 and the angle at B is 60\u00b0. Find the distance BC.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nAngle C = 180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 - 60\u00b0 = 45\u00b0\n\nUsing Sine Rule:\nBC/sin 75\u00b0 = 250/sin 45\u00b0\nBC = (250 \u00d7 sin 75\u00b0)/sin 45\u00b0\nBC = (250 \u00d7 0.966)/0.707\nBC \u2248 341 meters\n```\n\n**Answer**: The distance across the valley is approximately 341 meters.\n\n## Part 5: Cosine Rule\n\n**Formula**: \n- c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos C\n- cos C = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)/(2ab)\n\n### Nigerian Example: Abuja City Planning\n\n**Problem**: In Abuja's new city development, three landmarks form a triangle. The distance between Landmark A and B is 5 km, between B and C is 7 km, and between A and C is 9 km. Find the angle at Landmark B.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nUsing Cosine Rule:\ncos B = (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(2ac)\ncos B = (5\u00b2 + 7\u00b2 - 9\u00b2)/(2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7)\ncos B = (25 + 49 - 81)/70\ncos B = -7/70\ncos B = -0.1\nB \u2248 95.7\u00b0\n```\n\n**Answer**: The angle at Landmark B is approximately 96\u00b0.\n\n## Part 6: Area of Triangle\n\n**Formula**: Area = \u00bd ab sin C\n\n### Nigerian Example: Triangular Land Plot in Lagos\n\n**Problem**: A triangular plot of land in Lekki has two sides measuring 80 meters and 100 meters, with an included angle of 110\u00b0. Calculate the area and value at \u20a6200,000 per square meter.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nArea = \u00bd \u00d7 80 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 sin 110\u00b0\nArea = 4000 \u00d7 sin 110\u00b0\nArea = 4000 \u00d7 0.940\nArea \u2248 3,758 square meters\n\nValue = 3,758 \u00d7 \u20a6200,000\nValue \u2248 \u20a6751,600,000\n```\n\n**Answer**: The plot is approximately 3,758 m\u00b2 and worth about \u20a6752 million.\n\n## Worked Examples\n\n### Example 1: Telecommunications Tower Positioning\n\n**Problem**: Two Glo network towers are 5 km apart. From the first tower, the bearing to a fault location is 075\u00b0. From the second tower, the bearing to the same fault is 345\u00b0. Find the distance from each tower to the fault.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\n[Detailed solution using angles and Sine Rule]\n```\n\n### Example 2: Solar Panel Angle Optimization\n\n**Problem**: In Kaduna (latitude 10.5\u00b0N), what angle should solar panels be tilted for maximum efficiency during dry season?\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nOptimal tilt = Latitude + 15\u00b0 (for winter/dry season)\nOptimal tilt = 10.5\u00b0 + 15\u00b0 = 25.5\u00b0\n\nUse trigonometry to calculate support structure dimensions:\nIf panel length = 2 meters\nHeight = 2 \u00d7 sin 25.5\u00b0 \u2248 0.86 meters\nBase = 2 \u00d7 cos 25.5\u00b0 \u2248 1.80 meters\n```\n\n**Answer**: Tilt panels at 25.5\u00b0 with 0.86m height and 1.80m base.\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n### Problem 1: BRT Bus Route\nA BRT bus in Lagos travels 8 km on a bearing of 040\u00b0, then 6 km on a bearing of 130\u00b0. Find the direct distance from start to finish.\n\n**Hint**: Use Cosine Rule after finding the angle between the two paths.\n\n### Problem 2: Bridge Cable Tension\nOn the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge, a cable makes an angle of 65\u00b0 with the horizontal and is 50 meters long. Find the vertical height it supports.\n\n**Hint**: Use sin 65\u00b0 = height/50\n\n### Problem 3: Lighthouse Visibility\nFrom a lighthouse in Lagos Harbor (30 meters high), a ship is spotted at an angle of depression of 15\u00b0. How far is the ship from the lighthouse base?\n\n**Hint**: Use tan 15\u00b0 = 30/distance\n\n### Problem 4: Airport Landing Approach\nAn Air Peace aircraft approaching Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport is at an altitude of 800 meters and is 5 km horizontally from the runway. Calculate the angle of depression and glide path distance.\n\n**Hint**: Find angle using tan\u207b\u00b9, then use Pythagoras or sin/cos for distance.\n\n## WAEC Exam Strategies\n\n1. **Always Draw Diagrams**: Sketch the scenario, even for bearing problems\n2. **Label Everything**: Mark known angles, sides, and what you're finding\n3. **Check Calculator Mode**: Ensure you're in DEGREE mode, not radians\n4. **Use 3-Figure Bearings**: Write bearings as 045\u00b0, not 45\u00b0\n5. **Show All Steps**: WAEC awards method marks even if final answer is wrong\n6. **Round Appropriately**: Usually 3 significant figures or 1 decimal place\n7. **Verify Answers**: Use alternative method or estimation to check\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n1. **Confusing elevation and depression**: Remember they're equal (alternate angles)\n2. **Wrong calculator mode**: Double-check DEGREE vs RADIAN\n3. **Incorrect bearing calculations**: Always measure clockwise from North\n4. **Mixing up sin/cos/tan**: Remember SOHCAHTOA\n5. **Forgetting angle sum**: Triangle angles always sum to 180\u00b0\n\n## Nigerian Context Summary\n\n**Real-World Applications**:\n- **Telecommunications**: MTN, Glo, Airtel tower positioning (\u20a65M per tower)\n- **Surveying**: Abuja city planning, land measurement (\u20a6200,000/m\u00b2)\n- **Civil Engineering**: Bridge design (Niger Bridge, Lekki-Ikoyi Link)\n- **Navigation**: River Niger shipping routes, airport approaches\n- **Energy**: Solar panel optimization in northern Nigeria (25.5\u00b0 tilt)\n- **Natural Features**: Aso Rock height (256m), Obudu terrain surveying\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nAfter studying this lesson, you should be able to:\n1. \u2713 Apply SOHCAHTOA to solve right-angled triangle problems\n2. \u2713 Calculate heights and distances using angles of elevation/depression\n3. \u2713 Navigate using bearings and solve bearing problems\n4. \u2713 Use Sine Rule for non-right triangles\n5. \u2713 Apply Cosine Rule to find sides and angles\n6. \u2713 Calculate areas of triangles using trigonometry\n7. \u2713 Solve real Nigerian problems involving trigonometry\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Basic angle properties\n- Pythagoras' theorem\n- Calculator proficiency (sin, cos, tan functions)\n- Understanding of bearing notation\n\n## Next Topics\n\n- Graphs of trigonometric functions\n- Trigonometric identities\n- 3D trigonometry\n- Radians and circular measure\n",

      "content": "\n# Work, Energy and Power: From Kainji Dam to Lagos Markets\n\n## Introduction\n\nEnergy is the capacity to do work. In Nigeria, we see energy transformations everywhere: the 960 MW Kainji Dam converts water's potential energy to electricity, solar panels in Kaduna convert light energy, and generators in Lagos convert chemical energy from petrol into electrical energy. Understanding work, energy, and power is essential for WAEC success and real-world applications.\n\n## Part 1: Work Done\n\n### Definition\n\n**Work is done when a force moves an object through a distance in the direction of the force.**\n\n**Formula**: W = F \u00d7 d \u00d7 cos \u03b8\n\nWhere:\n- W = Work done (Joules, J)\n- F = Force applied (Newtons, N)\n- d = Distance moved (meters, m)\n- \u03b8 = Angle between force and direction of motion\n\n### Nigerian Example: Alaba International Market\n\n**Problem**: A trader at Alaba Market pushes a cart loaded with electronics 20 meters across the floor with a force of 150 N. Calculate the work done.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nW = F \u00d7 d\nW = 150 N \u00d7 20 m\nW = 3,000 J = 3 kJ\n```\n\n**Answer**: The trader does 3,000 Joules (3 kJ) of work.\n\n**WAEC Tip**: If the force and motion are in the same direction, \u03b8 = 0\u00b0 and cos 0\u00b0 = 1, so W = F \u00d7 d.\n\n### Example with Angle: Carrying Water Up Slope\n\n**Problem**: In a rural Nigerian village, a woman carries a 20 kg bucket of water (weight = 200 N) up a 10-meter slope inclined at 30\u00b0 to the horizontal. Find the work done against gravity.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nVertical height = 10 \u00d7 sin 30\u00b0 = 10 \u00d7 0.5 = 5 m\nW = F \u00d7 h\nW = 200 N \u00d7 5 m\nW = 1,000 J = 1 kJ\n```\n\n**Answer**: Work done against gravity is 1,000 J.\n\n## Part 2: Forms of Energy\n\n### 1. Kinetic Energy (KE)\n\n**Energy of motion**\n\n**Formula**: KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2\n\nWhere:\n- m = mass (kg)\n- v = velocity (m/s)\n\n### Nigerian Example: BRT Bus in Lagos\n\n**Problem**: A BRT bus with mass 8,000 kg travels at 20 m/s on Ikorodu Road. Calculate its kinetic energy.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nKE = \u00bdmv\u00b2\nKE = \u00bd \u00d7 8,000 \u00d7 (20)\u00b2\nKE = 4,000 \u00d7 400\nKE = 1,600,000 J = 1.6 MJ\n```\n\n**Answer**: The bus has 1.6 megajoules of kinetic energy.\n\n### 2. Potential Energy (PE)\n\n**Energy due to position**\n\n**Formula**: PE = mgh\n\nWhere:\n- m = mass (kg)\n- g = 10 m/s\u00b2 (gravitational field strength)\n- h = height (m)\n\n### Nigerian Example: Elevated Water Tank in Lagos\n\n**Problem**: A water tank in Victoria Island is 15 meters above ground and holds 2,000 kg of water. Calculate the potential energy of the water.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nPE = mgh\nPE = 2,000 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 15\nPE = 300,000 J = 300 kJ\n```\n\n**Answer**: The water has 300 kilojoules of potential energy.\n\n## Part 3: Conservation of Energy\n\n**Principle**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.\n\n**Total Energy**: KE + PE = constant (in the absence of friction)\n\n### Nigerian Example: Kainji Dam Hydroelectric Power\n\n**Problem**: Water at the top of Kainji Dam (80 m high) has mass 10,000 kg. Calculate:\na) Potential energy at the top\nb) Kinetic energy just before hitting turbines (bottom)\nc) Velocity at the bottom\n\n**Solution**:\n```\na) PE at top = mgh = 10,000 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 80 = 8,000,000 J = 8 MJ\n\nb) By conservation: PE(top) = KE(bottom)\n   KE = 8,000,000 J = 8 MJ\n\nc) KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2\n   8,000,000 = \u00bd \u00d7 10,000 \u00d7 v\u00b2\n   v\u00b2 = 1,600\n   v = 40 m/s\n```\n\n**Answer**: \na) PE = 8 MJ\nb) KE = 8 MJ  \nc) v = 40 m/s\n\n**Real Context**: Kainji Dam generates 960 MW, supplying electricity to northern and western Nigeria.\n\n## Part 4: Power\n\n### Definition\n\n**Power is the rate of doing work or rate of energy transfer.**\n\n**Formula**: P = W/t = E/t\n\nWhere:\n- P = Power (Watts, W)\n- W = Work done (J)\n- t = Time taken (s)\n- E = Energy transferred (J)\n\n**Also**: P = Fv (Power = Force \u00d7 velocity)\n\n### Nigerian Example: NEPA/PHCN Electricity Bill\n\n**Problem**: A Nigerian household in Lagos uses 300 kWh of electrical energy in a month (30 days). Calculate:\na) Average power consumption\nb) Monthly cost at \u20a668/kWh\n\n**Solution**:\n```\na) Energy = 300 kWh = 300,000 Wh = 300 \u00d7 3,600,000 J\n   Time = 30 days = 30 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 3600 s = 2,592,000 s\n   P = E/t = 300 kWh / (30 \u00d7 24) h\n   P = 300/720 kW = 0.417 kW \u2248 417 W\n\nb) Cost = 300 kWh \u00d7 \u20a668/kWh = \u20a620,400\n```\n\n**Answer**: \na) Average power = 417 W\nb) Monthly cost = \u20a620,400\n\n### Generator Fuel Consumption\n\n**Problem**: A 5 kW generator in Lagos runs for 8 hours daily. If fuel costs \u20a6617/litre and consumption is 0.5 litres/hour, find monthly fuel cost (30 days).\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nDaily consumption = 8 hours \u00d7 0.5 litres/hour = 4 litres\nMonthly consumption = 30 \u00d7 4 = 120 litres\nMonthly cost = 120 \u00d7 \u20a6617 = \u20a674,040\n```\n\n**Answer**: Monthly fuel cost = \u20a674,040\n\n## Part 5: Efficiency\n\n### Definition\n\n**Efficiency = (Useful output energy/Total input energy) \u00d7 100%**\n\n**Also**: Efficiency = (Output power/Input power) \u00d7 100%\n\n### Nigerian Example: Solar Panels in Kaduna\n\n**Problem**: A solar panel system in Kaduna receives 10,000 J of light energy per second and produces 1,800 J of electrical energy per second. Calculate:\na) Efficiency\nb) Output power\nc) Wasted power\n\n**Solution**:\n```\na) Efficiency = (1,800/10,000) \u00d7 100% = 18%\n\nb) Output power = 1,800 J/s = 1,800 W = 1.8 kW\n\nc) Wasted power = Input - Output = 10,000 - 1,800 = 8,200 W = 8.2 kW\n```\n\n**Answer**: \na) Efficiency = 18%\nb) Output power = 1.8 kW\nc) Wasted power = 8.2 kW\n\n**Real Context**: Solar panel efficiency in Nigeria typically ranges from 15-22%, with northern regions like Kaduna, Sokoto, and Kano having excellent solar potential.\n\n## Worked Examples\n\n### Example 1: Lifting Dangote Cement Bags\n\n**Problem**: A worker lifts a 50 kg bag of Dangote cement vertically through 2 meters in 3 seconds. Calculate:\na) Work done\nb) Power developed\n\n**Solution**:\n```\na) Weight = mg = 50 \u00d7 10 = 500 N\n   W = F \u00d7 d = 500 \u00d7 2 = 1,000 J\n\nb) P = W/t = 1,000/3 = 333.3 W\n```\n\n**Answer**: a) 1,000 J, b) 333 W\n\n### Example 2: Okada Motorcycle in Lagos Traffic\n\n**Problem**: An Okada (motorcycle taxi) with total mass 200 kg (bike + rider) accelerates from rest to 15 m/s. Calculate the kinetic energy gained.\n\n**Solution**:\n```\nInitial KE = 0 (at rest)\nFinal KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2 = \u00bd \u00d7 200 \u00d7 (15)\u00b2 = 100 \u00d7 225 = 22,500 J = 22.5 kJ\n```\n\n**Answer**: Kinetic energy gained = 22.5 kJ\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n### Problem 1: Eko Bridge Traffic\nA car of mass 1,200 kg travels at 25 m/s on Eko Bridge, Lagos.

      "content": "\n# Acids, Bases and Salts: Chemistry in Nigerian Daily Life\n\n## Introduction\nEvery day, Nigerians interact with acids, bases, and salts: car battery acid in Lagos markets (\u20a65,000), lime for building construction, Badagry salt production, soap making in Kano, and antacids for treating ulcers. Understanding these substances connects chemistry to Nigerian industries and daily life.\n\n## Part 1: Properties of Acids\n\n### Common Nigerian Acids\n- **Car battery acid** (sulfuric acid, H\u2082SO\u2084) - Lagos battery markets\n- **Vinegar** (acetic acid, CH\u2083COOH) - Nigerian cooking\n- **Citrus fruits** (citric acid) - Oranges, lemons\n- **Stomach acid** (hydrochloric acid, HCl) - Digestion\n\n### Acid Properties\n1. Sour taste (citrus fruits)\n2. Turn blue litmus paper red\n3. pH < 7\n4. React with metals to produce hydrogen gas\n5. React with carbonates to produce CO\u2082\n6. Neutralize bases\n\n### Worked Example 1: Car Battery Acid Reaction\nA mechanic in Lagos adds zinc metal to dilute sulfuric acid from a battery.\n\n**Reaction**: Zn + H\u2082SO\u2084 \u2192 ZnSO\u2084 + H\u2082\n\n**Observation**: Bubbles of hydrogen gas, zinc dissolves\n\n**Test**: Light a splint near gas \u2192 'pop' sound confirms H\u2082\n\n**Nigerian Context**: This reaction shows why battery terminals corrode over time and need cleaning/replacement (common issue in Nigerian vehicles).\n\n## Part 2: Properties of Bases\n\n### Common Nigerian Bases\n- **Lime** (calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)\u2082) - Building construction\n- **Caustic soda** (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) - Soap making\n- **Wood ash** (potassium hydroxide, KOH) - Traditional soap\n- **Ammonia** (NH\u2083) - Cleaning products\n\n### Base Properties\n1. Bitter taste (caution: do not taste!)\n2. Turn red litmus paper blue\n3. pH > 7\n4. Feel slippery/soapy\n5. Neutralize acids\n\n### Worked Example 2: Soap Making in Kano\nTraditional soap makers mix palm oil with wood ash extract (contains KOH).\n\n**Reaction**: Palm oil + KOH \u2192 Soap + Glycerol\n\n**Process**:\n1. Burn palm fronds to get ash\n2. Dissolve ash in water (extracts KOH)\n3. Filter solution\n4. Heat with palm oil for 2-3 hours\n5. Add salt to separate soap\n6. Mold and dry\n\n**Economics**: 10 liters palm oil (\u20a615,000) + ash (free) \u2192 50 bars soap (\u20a620,000 revenue) = \u20a65,000 profit\n\n**Nigerian Industry**: This traditional method is still used alongside modern factories in northern Nigeria.\n\n## Part 3: The pH Scale\n\n### Understanding pH\n- pH = power of Hydrogen\n- Scale: 0 to 14\n- pH 7 = Neutral (pure water)\n- pH < 7 = Acidic\n- pH > 7 = Basic/Alkaline\n\n### Nigerian Examples\n| Substance | pH | Category |\n|-----------|----|----|\n| Car battery acid | 1-2 | Strong acid |\n| Vinegar (Nigerian cooking) | 2-3 | Weak acid |\n| Orange juice | 3-4 | Weak acid |\n| Rain water (Lagos) | 5-6 | Slightly acidic |\n| Pure water | 7 | Neutral |\n| Blood | 7.4 | Slightly alkaline |\n| Antacid (for ulcers) | 9-10 | Base |\n| Lime water (construction) | 12-13 | Strong base |\n| Caustic soda (soap making) | 14 | Strong base |\n\n### Worked Example 3: Treating Ulcers with Antacids\nA patient with stomach acid (pH 2) takes an antacid tablet containing Mg(OH)\u2082.\n\n**Problem**: Explain how antacid works.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Stomach acid: HCl (pH 2, excess acid causes pain)\n- Antacid: Mg(OH)\u2082 (base)\n- **Neutralization**: 2HCl + Mg(OH)\u2082 \u2192 MgCl\u2082 + 2H\u2082O\n- Result: Acid neutralized, pH rises to ~5-6, pain relieved\n\n**Nigerian Market**: Antacids cost \u20a6500-2,000 per pack, common in pharmacies nationwide.\n\n## Part 4: Neutralization Reactions\n\n### General Equation\n**Acid + Base \u2192 Salt + Water**\n\n### Worked Example 4: Lime in Construction (Abuja)\nConstruction workers mix lime Ca(OH)\u2082 with CO\u2082 from air for cement hardening.\n\n**Reaction**: Ca(OH)\u2082 + CO\u2082 \u2192 CaCO\u2083 + H\u2082O\n\n**Process**:\n- Lime paste applied to walls\n- CO\u2082 from air slowly reacts\n- Forms hard calcium carbonate (limestone)\n- Takes weeks to fully harden\n\n**Economics**: 50kg bag lime \u20a63,000, covers 20m\u00b2 of wall\n\n**Nigerian Construction**: Essential for plastering in building projects across Nigeria.\n\n## Part 5: Preparation of Salts\n\n### Method 1: Acid + Metal\n**HCl + Zn \u2192 ZnCl\u2082 + H\u2082**\n\n### Method 2: Acid + Metal Oxide\n**H\u2082SO\u2084 + CuO \u2192 CuSO\u2084 + H\u2082O**\n\n### Method 3: Acid + Metal Carbonate\n**2HCl + CaCO\u2083 \u2192 CaCl\u2082 + H\u2082O + CO\u2082**\n\n### Method 4: Acid + Base (Neutralization)\n**HNO\u2083 + NaOH \u2192 NaNO\u2083 + H\u2082O**\n\n### Worked Example 5: Badagry Salt Production\nAt Badagry salt flats (Lagos State), seawater is evaporated to produce table salt (NaCl).\n\n**Process**:\n1. Seawater pumped into shallow ponds\n2. Sun evaporates water over 2-3 weeks\n3. Salt crystals form (NaCl concentration increases)\n4. Harvest and wash salt\n5. Dry and package\n\n**Yield**: 1000 liters seawater \u2192 30 kg salt (3% concentration)\n\n**Economics**: \n- Production cost: \u20a630/kg (evaporation, labor)\n- Selling price: \u20a650/kg wholesale\n- Annual production: 5,000+ tonnes in Badagry\n\n**Nigerian Industry**: Badagry salt industry employs thousands, supplies Lagos markets.\n\n### Worked Example 6: Preparing Zinc Chloride in Lab\nA student prepares zinc chloride salt from zinc metal and hydrochloric acid.\n\n**Procedure**:\n1. Add excess zinc granules to dilute HCl\n2. Reaction: Zn + 2HCl \u2192 ZnCl\u2082 + H\u2082\u2191\n3. Filter to remove unreacted zinc\n4. Evaporate filtrate to crystallization point\n5. Cool to form ZnCl\u2082 crystals\n6. Dry between filter papers\n\n**Safety**: Wear goggles, acid is corrosive\n\n**WAEC Practical**: Common exam question format\n\n## Part 6: Nigerian Industries Using Acids, Bases, Salts\n\n### Battery Industry (Lagos)\n- Lead-acid batteries use H\u2082SO\u2084\n- Market: Alaba International Market\n- Price: \u20a65,000-25,000 per battery\n- Recycling: Old batteries bought for \u20a61,500\n\n### Soap Manufacturing (Kano)\n- Traditional: Wood ash (KOH) + palm oil\n- Modern: Caustic soda (NaOH) + various oils\n- Annual production: 100,000+ tonnes\n- Employs: 50,000+ workers\n\n### Salt Production (Badagry)\n- Seawater evaporation\n- Annual yield: 5,000+ tonnes\n- Supplies: Lagos markets\n- Price: \u20a650-80/kg wholesale\n\n### Construction (Nationwide)\n- Lime (Ca(OH)\u2082) for plastering\n- Cement neutralization\n- Annual consumption: 500,000+ tonnes\n- Price: \u20a63,000 per 50kg bag\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Memorize neutralization equation**: Acid + Base \u2192 Salt + Water\n2. **pH scale**: Know which substances are acidic/basic\n3. **Litmus tests**: Blue \u2192 red (acid), Red \u2192 blue (base)\n4. **Salt preparation methods**: Choose correct method for given salt\n5. **Balance equations**: Always balance chemical equations\n6. **Safety**: Mention safety precautions in practicals\n7. **Show all steps**: WAEC awards method marks\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: A Nigerian farmer notices his soil pH is 5 (too acidic for crops).

      "content": "\n# Nutrition in Plants: Feeding Nigeria's Farms\n\n## Introduction\nNigeria feeds 220 million people through agriculture. From cassava farms in Benue to cocoa plantations in Ondo, from yam cultivation in Enugu to maize fields in Kaduna\u2014all depend on plant nutrition. Understanding photosynthesis and mineral requirements is essential for Nigerian food security.\n\n## Part 1: Photosynthesis - The Foundation\n\n### The Process\n**6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + light energy \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082**\n(Carbon dioxide + Water \u2192 Glucose + Oxygen)\n\n### Requirements\n1. **Chlorophyll** - Green pigment in chloroplasts\n2. **Light energy** - From sunlight\n3. **Carbon dioxide** - From air (0.04%)\n4. **Water** - From soil via roots\n\n### Products\n1. **Glucose** - Used for energy, growth, storage\n2. **Oxygen** - Released to atmosphere\n\n### Worked Example 1: Cassava Photosynthesis (Benue State)\nA cassava farm in Benue has 10,000 plants. Each plant has ~200 leaves averaging 400 cm\u00b2 per leaf.\n\n**Calculate total photosynthetic surface area**.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Leaves per plant = 200\n- Total plants = 10,000\n- Total leaves = 200 \u00d7 10,000 = 2,000,000 leaves\n- Area per leaf = 400 cm\u00b2 = 0.04 m\u00b2\n- Total area = 2,000,000 \u00d7 0.04 = 80,000 m\u00b2\n- **Total area = 8 hectares of photosynthetic surface**\n\n**Nigerian Context**: Large surface area explains why cassava is efficient at producing tubers (40-50 tonnes/hectare possible with good fertilizer).\n\n## Part 2: Factors Affecting Photosynthesis\n\n### 1. Light Intensity\n- **Too low**: Slow photosynthesis (cloudy days, rainy season)\n- **Optimal**: Bright sunlight (Nigerian dry season)\n- **Too high**: No further increase (light saturation)\n\n### Nigerian Example: Cocoa Under Shade\nIn Ondo State, cocoa trees grow under taller trees (plantain, kola).\n\n**Why?** Young cocoa needs 50-70% shade:\n- Prevents excessive light damage\n- Reduces water loss\n- Optimal photosynthesis at moderate light\n- Mature cocoa tolerates more light\n\n**Economics**: Shade trees = \u20a650,000 investment, but increase cocoa yield by 30%\n\n### 2. Carbon Dioxide Concentration\n- Normal air: 0.04% CO\u2082\n- Optimal: 0.1% CO\u2082 (2.5\u00d7 normal)\n- Limiting factor in closed spaces\n\n### 3. Temperature\n- **Too low** (<10\u00b0C): Enzymes inactive (not common in Nigeria)\n- **Optimal**: 25-35\u00b0C (Nigerian average)\n- **Too high** (>40\u00b0C): Enzymes denature, stomata close\n\n### Worked Example 2: Maize Growth in Kaduna\nIn Kaduna, maize grows in two seasons:\n\n**Dry season irrigation**:\n- Temperature: 30-35\u00b0C (optimal)\n- Light: High intensity (clear skies)\n- Water: Supplemented by irrigation\n- Growth: 3-4 months, 6-8 tonnes/hectare\n\n**Rainy season**:\n- Temperature: 25-30\u00b0C (good)\n- Light: Reduced (cloudy days)\n- Water: Abundant\n- Growth: 4-5 months, 4-6 tonnes/hectare\n\n**Analysis**: Dry season yields more despite needing irrigation because of higher light intensity and temperature.\n\n### 4. Water Availability\n- Required for photosynthesis\n- Maintains turgor pressure\n- Transport medium for nutrients\n- Cooling (transpiration)\n\n## Part 3: Mineral Nutrition\n\n### Macronutrients (Needed in Large Amounts)\n\n#### Nitrogen (N)\n- **Function**: Protein synthesis, chlorophyll, amino acids\n- **Deficiency**: Yellow older leaves, stunted growth\n- **Nigerian source**: Urea (46% N), NPK fertilizer\n- **Cost**: \u20a615,000 per 50kg NPK 20-10-10\n\n#### Phosphorus (P)\n- **Function**: DNA, RNA, ATP (energy), root development\n- **Deficiency**: Dark green/purple leaves, poor root growth\n- **Nigerian source**: Single superphosphate, NPK\n- **Application**: Important for yam, cassava root formation\n\n#### Potassium (K)\n- **Function**: Enzyme activation, stomata operation, disease resistance\n- **Deficiency**: Yellow leaf edges, weak stems\n- **Nigerian source**: Muriate of potash, NPK fertilizer\n\n### Micronutrients (Needed in Small Amounts)\n- Iron (Fe) - Chlorophyll synthesis\n- Magnesium (Mg) - Center of chlorophyll molecule\n- Calcium (Ca) - Cell wall formation\n- Sulfur (S) - Protein synthesis\n\n### Worked Example 3: NPK Fertilizer Application (Benue Cassava Farm)\nA farmer applies NPK 20-10-10 at 300 kg/hectare on 5 hectares.\n\n**Calculate nutrients applied:**\n\n**Solution**:\n- Total NPK = 300 kg/ha \u00d7 5 ha = 1,500 kg\n- **Nitrogen**: 20% of 1,500 = 300 kg pure N\n- **Phosphorus**: 10% of 1,500 = 150 kg pure P\u2082O\u2085\n- **Potassium**: 10% of 1,500 = 150 kg pure K\u2082O\n\n**Cost**: 1,500 kg \u00f7 50 kg/bag = 30 bags\n30 bags \u00d7 \u20a615,000 = **\u20a6450,000 total fertilizer cost**\n\n**Expected yield increase**: \n- Without fertilizer: 15 tonnes/ha\n- With fertilizer: 30-40 tonnes/ha\n- Extra yield: 15-25 tonnes/ha \u00d7 5 ha = 75-125 tonnes\n- @ \u20a650,000/tonne = \u20a63.75-6.25M revenue\n- **Profit after fertilizer**: \u20a63.3-5.8M\n\n**ROI**: 733-1289% return on fertilizer investment!\n\n## Part 4: Nutrient Deficiency in Nigerian Crops\n\n### Nitrogen Deficiency (Most Common)\n**Symptoms**:\n- Yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis)\n- Stunted growth\n- Thin, weak stems\n\n**Nigerian crops affected**: Maize, rice, vegetables\n\n**Solution**: Apply urea (46% N) at 100-200 kg/ha or NPK\n\n**Prevention**: Regular fertilizer application, crop rotation with legumes (beans, cowpea)\n\n### Phosphorus Deficiency\n**Symptoms**:\n- Dark green or purple leaves\n- Poor root development\n- Delayed maturity\n\n**Nigerian crops affected**: Yam, cassava, sweet potato\n\n**Solution**: Single superphosphate at planting\n\n### Iron Deficiency (Chlorosis)\n**Symptoms**:\n- Yellow young leaves (veins stay green)\n- Interveinal chlorosis\n\n**Nigerian crops affected**: Citrus, vegetables in alkaline soils\n\n**Solution**: Foliar spray of iron chelate, adjust soil pH\n\n### Worked Example 4: Diagnosing Maize Deficiency (Kaduna)\nA farmer notices his maize has:\n- Yellow older leaves\n- Thin, weak stems  \n- Slow growth despite adequate water\n\n**Diagnosis**: Nitrogen deficiency\n\n**Treatment**:\n1. Apply urea (46% N) at 150 kg/hectare\n2. Or NPK 20-10-10 at 200 kg/hectare\n3. Split application: Half at 3 weeks, half at 6 weeks\n4. Expect improvement in 1-2 weeks\n\n**Cost**: Urea 150kg @ \u20a620,000/50kg = \u20a660,000/hectare\n\n## Part 5: Transport in Plants\n\n### Xylem (Water & Minerals Up)\n- Dead cells forming tubes\n- Transport from roots to leaves\n- Driven by transpiration pull\n- Contains dissolved minerals (N, P, K, etc.)\n\n### Phloem (Sugars/Food Down)\n- Living cells (sieve tubes)\n- Transport sugars from leaves to storage organs\n- Bidirectional flow\n- Active transport (requires energy)\n\n### Worked Example 5: Water Uptake in Palm Trees (Southeast Nigeria)\nAn oil palm tree in Imo State transpires 40 liters of water daily during dry season.\n\n**Calculate weekly water requirement:**\n\n**Solution**:\n- Daily: 40 liters\n- Weekly: 40 \u00d7 7 = 280 liters = 280 kg water\n- Annual: 40 \u00d7 365 = 14,600 liters \u2248 14.6 tonnes\n\n**Implication**: This water carries dissolved NPK nutrients from soil to leaves. Without adequate soil moisture, nutrient uptake is impaired even with fertilizer application.\n\n**Nigerian farming practice**: Mulching around palm base conserves soil moisture, reduces transpiration losses.\n\n## Part 6: Nigerian Agricultural Applications\n\n### Cassava Farming (40 million tonnes/year)\n- Main producing states: Benue, Cross River, Delta\n- NPK requirement: 300-400 kg/ha (20-10-10)\n- Yield: 15-40 tonnes/ha depending on fertilizer\n- Market price: \u20a650,000/tonne (\u20a6750,000-2M/ha revenue)\n\n### Yam Cultivation (47 million tonnes/year - world's largest)\n- Main states: Benue, Taraba, Enugu, Niger\n- High P requirement for tuber development\n- NPK 12-12-17 at 300 kg/ha\n- Yield: 15-30 tonnes/ha\n- Price: \u20a6200-300/kg (\u20a63-9M/ha revenue)\n\n### Cocoa Production (250,000+ tonnes/year)\n- Main states: Ondo, Cross River, Osun, Edo\n- Shade requirements (50-70% for young trees)\n- NPK 15-15-15 at 200 kg/ha\n- Yield: 400-800 kg/ha dried beans\n- Export price: \u20a61,500-2,000/kg\n\n### Maize Farming (11 million tonnes/year)\n- Main states: Kaduna, Kano, Niger, Taraba\n- N requirement very high (urea 200-300 kg/ha)\n- Yield: 4-8 tonnes/ha\n- Price: \u20a6200/kg (\u20a6800,000-1.6M/ha)\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Photosynthesis equation**: Memorize word and chemical equations\n2. **Limiting factors**: Understand light, CO\u2082, temperature, water\n3. **Deficiency symptoms**: Yellow older leaves = N, Purple = P, Yellow edges = K\n4. **Practical skills**: Test for starch (iodine), test for CO\u2082 (limewater)\n5. **Nigerian examples**: Use local crops in answers (cassava, yam, maize)\n6. **Show calculations**: NPK percentages, fertilizer quantities\n7. **Draw diagrams**: Chloroplast structure, leaf cross-section\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: A 10-hectare cassava farm requires NPK 20-10-10 at 300 kg/ha.

      "content": "\n# Nutrition in Animals: Understanding the Nigerian Diet\n\n## Introduction\nNigeria's rich culinary tradition\u2014Jollof rice, Egusi soup, Pounded yam, Suya, Moi-moi\u2014provides the nutrients our bodies need. Understanding nutrition helps explain why a balanced Nigerian diet includes these foods and how our digestive system processes them.\n\n## Part 1: Classes of Food\n\n### 1. Carbohydrates (Energy Foods)\n**Function**: Provide energy (1g = 4 kcal)\n\n**Nigerian sources**:\n- **Rice** (Jollof rice) - 80% carbohydrate\n- **Yam** (Pounded yam, boiled yam) - 28% carbohydrate\n- **Cassava** (Garri, fufu) - 38% carbohydrate\n- **Maize** (Corn, pap/ogi) - 75% carbohydrate\n- **Plantain** (Dodo, boiled) - 32% carbohydrate\n\n**Types**:\n- **Simple sugars**: Glucose, fructose (fruits, honey)\n- **Complex starches**: Rice, yam, cassava\n\n**Daily requirement**: 300-400g (60% of total energy)\n\n### 2. Proteins (Body-building Foods)\n**Function**: Growth, repair, enzymes, antibodies (1g = 4 kcal)\n\n**Nigerian sources**:\n- **Beans** (Moi-moi, Akara) - 22% protein\n- **Fish** (Tilapia, catfish, stockfish) - 20-25% protein\n- **Meat** (Beef, goat, chicken, suya) - 20-25% protein\n- **Eggs** - 13% protein\n- **Groundnuts** - 25% protein\n- **Soy beans** - 36% protein\n\n**Types**:\n- **Complete proteins**: Meat, fish, eggs (contain all essential amino acids)\n- **Incomplete proteins**: Beans, nuts (lack some amino acids)\n\n**Daily requirement**: 50-70g for adults\n\n### 3. Fats and Oils (Energy Storage)\n**Function**: Energy storage, insulation, vitamin absorption (1g = 9 kcal - highest energy)\n\n**Nigerian sources**:\n- **Palm oil** (Red oil) - Used in soups, stews\n- **Groundnut oil** - For frying\n- **Coconut oil** - Traditional cooking\n- **Butter/margarine** - Bread, baking\n- **Fish oil** (from oily fish)\n\n**Daily requirement**: 50-70g (25-30% of total energy)\n\n### 4. Vitamins (Regulatory/Protective)\n**Function**: Regulate body processes, prevent diseases\n\n**Key vitamins in Nigerian diet**:\n- **Vitamin A**: Palm oil (red color = carotene), carrots, green vegetables\n  - Deficiency: Night blindness, dry skin\n- **Vitamin C**: Oranges, tomatoes, peppers\n  - Deficiency: Scurvy (bleeding gums)\n- **Vitamin D**: Fish, eggs, sunshine (Nigeria has plenty!)\n  - Deficiency: Rickets (soft bones in children)\n- **Vitamin B complex**: Yam, rice, beans, meat\n  - Deficiency: Beriberi, anemia\n\n### 5. Minerals (Regulatory/Structural)\n**Function**: Bones, teeth, blood, enzymes\n\n**Key minerals**:\n- **Calcium**: Milk, fish (bones), vegetables\n  - Function: Strong bones and teeth\n- **Iron**: Meat, beans, green vegetables\n  - Function: Hemoglobin (carries oxygen)\n  - Deficiency: Anemia (common in Nigeria)\n- **Iodine**: Iodized salt, fish\n  - Function: Thyroid hormone\n  - Deficiency: Goiter (swollen neck)\n\n### 6. Water\n**Function**: Transport, temperature regulation, chemical reactions\n\n**Daily requirement**: 2-3 liters (8-10 glasses)\n\n**Nigerian context**: Pure water sachets (\u20a610 each), boreholes, treated tap water\n\n### 7. Fiber (Roughage)\n**Function**: Aids digestion, prevents constipation\n\n**Nigerian sources**: Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans\n\n## Part 2: Balanced Diet - The Nigerian Approach\n\n### Traditional 6-3-1 Method\nNigerian nutritionists recommend:\n- **6 portions**: Carbohydrates (Rice, yam, garri, etc.)\n- **3 portions**: Proteins (Fish, meat, beans)\n- **1 portion**: Vegetables/fruits\n\n### Sample Balanced Nigerian Meals\n\n#### Breakfast (\u20a6500-800)\n- Bread + Akara + Pap\n- OR Boiled yam + egg sauce\n- OR Plantain + beans\n\n#### Lunch/Dinner (\u20a61,200-2,000)\n- **Main**: Jollof rice with chicken/fish\n- **Soup option**: Egusi soup + pounded yam + beef\n- **Swallow option**: Eba + vegetable soup + fish\n- **Side**: Salad, fruit\n\n**Daily cost for balanced diet in Lagos**: \u20a61,500-2,500\n\n### Worked Example 1: Calculating Daily Nutrition Needs\nA 70kg adult male in Lagos needs:\n- Energy: 2,500 kcal/day\n- Protein: 56g/day (0.8g per kg body weight)\n- Fat: 70g/day\n\n**Sample menu**:\n- **Breakfast**: Bread (200 kcal) + Akara (150 kcal) + Pap (100 kcal) = 450 kcal, 12g protein\n- **Lunch**: Jollof rice (400 kcal) + Chicken (200 kcal) + Salad (50 kcal) = 650 kcal, 25g protein\n- **Dinner**: Pounded yam (500 kcal) + Egusi soup (300 kcal) + Fish (150 kcal) = 950 kcal, 30g protein\n- **Snacks**: Fruits, nuts (400 kcal), 8g protein\n\n**Total**: 2,450 kcal, 75g protein \u2705 **Meets requirements**\n\n## Part 3: Human Digestive System\n\n### Organs and Functions\n\n#### 1. Mouth (Oral Cavity)\n**Process**: Mechanical digestion (chewing), chemical digestion (saliva)\n- **Teeth**: Break food into smaller pieces\n- **Saliva**: Contains amylase enzyme\n- **Reaction**: Starch \u2192 Maltose (sugar)\n\n**Nigerian example**: Chewing pounded yam requires strong molars; saliva begins breaking down starch immediately.\n\n#### 2. Esophagus (Food Pipe)\n**Process**: Peristalsis (wave-like muscle contractions push food down)\n- Length: ~25 cm\n- Time: 10-15 seconds for food to reach stomach\n\n#### 3. Stomach\n**Process**: Mechanical churning + chemical digestion\n- **Gastric juice**: Contains HCl (pH 2) + pepsin enzyme\n- **Reaction**: Proteins \u2192 Peptides\n- **Time**: Food stays 2-4 hours\n\n**Nigerian example**: After eating suya (protein), pepsin breaks down meat proteins. Acidic environment kills bacteria.\n\n#### 4. Small Intestine (6-7 meters long)\n**Three parts**: Duodenum, Jejunum, Ileum\n\n**Duodenum** (first 25cm):\n- **Bile** (from liver): Emulsifies fats\n- **Pancreatic juice**: Contains lipase, amylase, trypsin\n- **Reactions**:\n  - Fats \u2192 Fatty acids + Glycerol (lipase)\n  - Starch \u2192 Maltose \u2192 Glucose (amylase)\n  - Proteins \u2192 Amino acids (trypsin)\n\n**Jejunum & Ileum**:\n- **Absorption**: Nutrients absorbed through villi into bloodstream\n- **Surface area**: Increased by millions of villi (finger-like projections)\n\n**Nigerian example**: After eating Egusi soup (high fat content), bile emulsifies the palm oil into tiny droplets, then lipase breaks them down for absorption.\n\n#### 5. Large Intestine (Colon)\n**Process**: Water reabsorption, formation of feces\n- Length: 1.5 meters\n- **Time**: 12-24 hours\n- **Absorption**: Water, vitamins\n\n**Nigerian context**: Adequate fiber (from vegetables) prevents constipation by retaining water in colon.\n\n#### 6. Rectum and Anus\n**Process**: Storage and elimination of feces (egestion)\n\n### Worked Example 2: Digestion Timeline for Nigerian Meal\nA person eats Jollof rice + chicken at 2:00 PM.\n\n**Timeline**:\n- **2:00 PM**: Mouth - Chewing, saliva begins starch digestion\n- **2:01 PM**: Swallowing, esophagus transport (15 seconds)\n- **2:01-6:00 PM**: Stomach - Protein digestion (4 hours)\n- **6:00-8:00 PM**: Small intestine - Complete digestion and absorption (2 hours)\n- **8:00 PM-10:00 AM** (next day): Large intestine - Water absorption (14 hours)\n- **10:00 AM**: Egestion (feces)\n\n**Total time**: Mouth to anus = ~20 hours\n\n## Part 4: Absorption and Assimilation\n\n### Villi Structure (Small Intestine)\n- **Shape**: Finger-like projections\n- **Function**: Increase surface area for absorption\n- **Structure**:\n  - Thin wall (one cell thick)\n  - Rich blood supply (capillaries)\n  - Lacteal (for fat absorption)\n\n### What Gets Absorbed Where\n\n**Small intestine**:\n- Glucose \u2192 Blood \u2192 Liver \u2192 Body cells\n- Amino acids \u2192 Blood \u2192 Liver \u2192 Body cells\n- Fatty acids + Glycerol \u2192 Lymph \u2192 Blood\n- Vitamins, minerals \u2192 Blood\n\n**Large intestine**:\n- Water \u2192 Blood\n- Vitamins (K, B12 produced by bacteria) \u2192 Blood\n\n### Assimilation\nNutrients used by body cells:\n- **Glucose**: Respiration for energy (or stored as glycogen)\n- **Amino acids**: Build new proteins (muscles, enzymes)\n- **Fatty acids**: Energy storage (or cell membranes)\n\n## Part 5: Food Tests (WAEC Practicals)\n\n### Test for Starch (Iodine Test)\n- **Reagent**: Iodine solution (brown)\n- **Positive result**: Blue-black color\n- **Nigerian foods**: Yam, cassava, rice, maize\n\n**Procedure**:\n1. Grind food sample\n2. Add 2-3 drops iodine solution\n3. Observe color change\n\n### Test for Reducing Sugars (Benedict's Test)\n- **Reagent**: Benedict's solution (blue)\n- **Method**: Heat in water bath\n- **Positive result**: Green \u2192 Yellow \u2192 Orange \u2192 Brick-red (depending on sugar concentration)\n- **Nigerian foods**: Fruits, honey\n\n### Test for Proteins (Biuret Test)\n- **Reagents**: NaOH + Copper sulfate\n- **Positive result**: Purple/violet color\n- **Nigerian foods**: Beans, fish, meat, eggs\n\n### Test for Fats (Grease Spot Test)\n- **Method**: Rub food on filter paper, hold against light\n- **Positive result**: Translucent (greasy) spot\n- **Nigerian foods**: Palm oil, groundnut oil, butter\n\n### Worked Example 3: Testing Nigerian Foods\nA student tests four foods: Garri, groundnut, orange juice, fish.\n\n**Results**:\n| Food | Iodine | Benedict's | Biuret | Grease Spot |\n|------|--------|------------|--------|-------------|\n| Garri | Blue-black | Negative | Negative | Negative |\n| Groundnut | Negative | Negative | Purple | Translucent |\n| Orange juice | Negative | Orange | Negative | Negative |\n| Fish | Negative | Negative | Purple | Slight translucent |\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- Garri: Rich in starch\n- Groundnut: Contains protein and fat\n- Orange juice: Contains reducing sugars (fructose, glucose)\n- Fish: Contains protein and some fat\n\n## Part 6: Malnutrition in Nigerian Context\n\n### Protein-Energy Malnutrition\n\n#### Kwashiorkor\n**Cause**: Severe protein deficiency (child weaned to starchy diet)\n**Symptoms**:\n- Swollen belly (fluid retention)\n- Thin limbs\n- Skin lesions\n- Hair discoloration (orange/red)\n\n**Nigerian context**: Common in rural areas where children eat mostly garri/pap with little protein\n\n**Prevention**: Include beans, fish, eggs in children's diet\n\n#### Marasmus\n**Cause**: Severe calorie and protein deficiency\n**Symptoms**:\n- Extreme thinness\n- Wrinkled skin\n- No fat or muscle\n\n**Prevention**: Adequate food quantity and quality\n\n### Vitamin Deficiencies\n\n#### Vitamin A Deficiency\n**Symptoms**: Night blindness, dry eyes\n**Nigerian prevention**: Red palm oil (rich in carotene), carrots\n\n#### Vitamin C Deficiency (Scurvy)\n**Symptoms**: Bleeding gums, slow wound healing\n**Nigerian prevention**: Oranges (\u20a650-100 each), tomatoes, peppers\n\n#### Iron Deficiency (Anemia)\n**Symptoms**: Fatigue, pale skin, dizziness\n**Common in**: Pregnant women, children\n**Nigerian prevention**: Red meat, beans, green vegetables, iron supplements\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Food classes**: Memorize all 7 classes and Nigerian examples\n2. **Digestive system**: Draw and label diagram accurately\n3. **Enzymes**: Know where each enzyme works (amylase, pepsin, lipase, trypsin)\n4. **Food tests**: Learn all 4 tests, reagents, and results\n5. **Balanced diet**: Use Nigerian foods in explanations\n6. **Deficiency diseases**: Link to symptoms and prevention\n7. **Show calculations**: Energy content, daily requirements\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: Plan a balanced Nigerian meal for a family of 4 with \u20a65,000 budget.
