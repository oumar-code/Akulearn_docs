## Geological and Astronomical Principles

### Earth's Internal Structure
- **Differentiation:** Denser materials (iron/nickel) sank to core during Earth's formation
- **Layering:** Earth has chemically distinct layers (crust, mantle, core)
- **Temperature gradient:** Increases from ~15°C at surface to ~5,000°C at inner core
- **Pressure gradient:** Increases with depth due to overlying material weight

### Plate Tectonics
- **Continental drift:** Plates move 2-10 cm per year
- **Boundary types:**
  - Convergent: Plates collide, forming mountains/trenches
  - Divergent: Plates separate, creating new crust at mid-ocean ridges
  - Transform: Plates slide past each other, causing earthquakes
- **Nigerian context:** West African craton (stable), but affected by distant plate activity

### Volcanic Processes
- **Magma formation:** Partial melting of mantle rock due to pressure/temperature changes
- **Eruption types:**
  - Effusive: Lava flows (shown in model)
  - Explosive: Ash plumes (shown in model)
- **Volcanic structures:** Shield, stratovolcano, cinder cone
- **Nigerian context:** Jos Plateau has extinct volcanic features

### Hydrological Cycle
- **Energy source:** Solar radiation drives evaporation
- **Phase changes:**
  - Evaporation: Liquid → gas (water → vapor)
  - Condensation: Gas → liquid (vapor → clouds)
  - Precipitation: Clouds release water as rain/snow
- **Nigerian context:** Tropical climate with distinct wet/dry seasons

### Rock Cycle
- **Rock classification:**
  - Igneous: Formed from cooling magma/lava
  - Sedimentary: Formed from compacted sediments
  - Metamorphic: Formed by heat/pressure on existing rocks
- **Transformation processes:**
  - Weathering: Physical/chemical breakdown
  - Compaction: Pressure forming sedimentary rock
  - Metamorphism: Heat/pressure changing rock structure
  - Melting: High temperature forming magma

### Lunar Phases
- **Orbital period:** 29.5 days (synodic month)
- **Phase cycle:** New → Waxing → Full → Waning → New
- **Illumination:** Always 50% of Moon is lit by Sun; phases show which part is visible from Earth
- **Cultural significance:** Lunar calendar used in some Nigerian communities
