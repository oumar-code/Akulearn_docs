Organic Chemistry: Hydrocarbons,Chemistry,Organic Chemistry,Hydrocarbons,study_guide,intermediate,WAEC,"# Organic Chemistry: Hydrocarbons

## Introduction
Hydrocarbons are organic compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms. They are the simplest organic compounds and form the basis of organic chemistry.

## Classification of Hydrocarbons

### Aliphatic Hydrocarbons
- **Alkanes**: Saturated hydrocarbons (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂)
- **Alkenes**: Unsaturated hydrocarbons with double bonds (CₙH₂ₙ)
- **Alkynes**: Unsaturated hydrocarbons with triple bonds (CₙH₂ₙ₋₂)

### Aromatic Hydrocarbons
- Contain benzene ring structure
- General formula: C₆H₆ for benzene
- Examples: Benzene, toluene, xylene

## Alkanes

### Properties
- Saturated (single bonds only)
- General formula: CₙH₂ₙ₊₂
- Non-polar molecules
- Insoluble in water, soluble in organic solvents

### Reactions
- **Combustion**: Complete burning in oxygen
  CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O

- **Substitution**: Reaction with halogens
  CH₄ + Cl₂ → CH₃Cl + HCl (in sunlight)

### Isomerism
- Structural isomers: Same molecular formula, different structures
- Example: Butane (C₄H₁₀) has 2 isomers

## Alkenes

### Properties
- Contain carbon-carbon double bonds
- General formula: CₙH₂ₙ
- More reactive than alkanes
- Undergo addition reactions

### Reactions
- **Addition of Hydrogen**: Hydrogenation
  CH₂=CH₂ + H₂ → CH₃-CH₃

- **Addition of Halogens**: Halogenation
  CH₂=CH₂ + Br₂ → CH₂Br-CH₂Br

- **Addition of Water**: Hydration
  CH₂=CH₂ + H₂O → CH₃-CH₂OH (requires acid catalyst)

## Alkynes

### Properties
- Contain carbon-carbon triple bonds
- General formula: CₙH₂ₙ₋₂
- More reactive than alkenes
- First member: Acetylene (C₂H₂)

### Reactions
- **Addition reactions**: Similar to alkenes but can add twice
- **Combustion**: Very exothermic
  2C₂H₂ + 5O₂ → 4CO₂ + 2H₂O

## Aromatic Hydrocarbons

### Benzene (C₆H₆)
- Special stability due to delocalized electrons
- Undergoes substitution rather than addition reactions
- Kekulé structure shows alternating double bonds

### Reactions of Benzene
- **Nitration**: C₆H₆ + HNO₃ → C₆H₅NO₂ + H₂O
- **Sulphonation**: C₆H₆ + H₂SO₄ → C₆H₅SO₃H + H₂O
- **Halogenation**: C₆H₆ + Cl₂ → C₆H₅Cl + HCl

## Nigerian Applications
- Petroleum refining in Port Harcourt and Lagos
- Natural gas processing
- Petrochemical industry
- Fuel production for transportation

## Laboratory Preparation
- Alkanes: Reduction of alkyl halides
- Alkenes: Dehydration of alcohols, dehydrohalogenation
- Alkynes: Action of water on carbides

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing general formulas
- Incorrect naming of isomers
- Forgetting reaction conditions
- Mixing up addition vs substitution reactions

## Introduction
Chemical kinetics is the study of reaction rates and the factors that affect them. Understanding reaction rates is crucial for industrial processes and chemical analysis.

## Rate of Reaction
The rate of reaction is the change in concentration of reactants or products per unit time.

**Average Rate:** Total change over a period of time
**Instantaneous Rate:** Rate at a particular moment

### Units
- Rate = concentration/time
- Common units: mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹, mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹

## Factors Affecting Reaction Rates

### Concentration
- Rate ∝ [Reactants] for most reactions
- Rate = k[A]ⁿ[B]ᵐ (rate law)
- Order of reaction: n + m

### Temperature
- Rate doubles/triples for every 10°C rise (Rule of Thumb)
- Arrhenius equation: k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)
- Activation energy (Ea) determines temperature sensitivity

### Catalyst
- Increases reaction rate without being consumed
- Lowers activation energy
- Provides alternative reaction pathway

### Surface Area
- Larger surface area = faster reaction
- Important for heterogeneous reactions
- Particle size affects reaction rate

### Pressure
- Affects gaseous reactions
- Rate increases with pressure for reactions producing fewer gas molecules

## Order of Reaction

### Zero Order
- Rate = k (independent of concentration)
- Example: Decomposition on metal surfaces

### First Order
- Rate = k[A]
- Half-life constant: t½ = 0.693/k
- Examples: Radioactive decay, hydrolysis

### Second Order
- Rate = k[A]² or k[A][B]
- Half-life depends on initial concentration
- Examples: Alkaline hydrolysis of esters

## Rate Laws and Rate Constants

### Differential Rate Law
Expresses rate in terms of concentration derivatives

### Integrated Rate Law
Expresses concentration as function of time

### Zero Order: [A] = [A]₀ - kt
### First Order: ln[A] = ln[A]₀ - kt
### Second Order: 1/[A] = 1/[A]₀ + kt

## Activation Energy
- Minimum energy required for reaction
- Determined from Arrhenius plot: ln k vs 1/T
- Slope = -Ea/R

## Reaction Mechanisms
- Series of elementary steps
- Rate-determining step controls overall rate
- Molecularity vs order of reaction

## Nigerian Industrial Applications
- Petroleum refining reaction rates
- Cement manufacturing kinetics
- Food processing and preservation
- Pharmaceutical production timing
- Fertilizer manufacturing processes

## Experimental Methods
- Colorimetry for concentration measurement
- Gas collection for gaseous products
- Titration methods

## Common Mistakes

- Incorrect units for rate constants
- Misapplying integrated rate laws
- Forgetting temperature effects

2. Determine order of reaction from given rate data
3. Calculate activation energy from rate constants at two temperatures
4. Explain effect of catalyst on reaction rate
