Newton's Laws of Motion,Physics,Mechanics,Laws of Motion,study_guide,intermediate,WAEC,"# Newton's Laws of Motion

## First Law (Law of Inertia)
**Statement:** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

**Inertia** is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion.

### Examples:
- A book on a table remains at rest until pushed
- A moving car continues moving until brakes are applied
- Passengers in a bus fall forward when the bus stops suddenly

## Second Law (F = ma)
**Statement:** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

**Formula:** F = ma
- F = force (N)
- m = mass (kg)
- a = acceleration (m/s²)

### Examples:
- More force = more acceleration (same mass)
- More mass = less acceleration (same force)
- Force and acceleration are in the same direction

## Third Law (Action-Reaction)
**Statement:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

### Examples:
- Rocket propulsion: exhaust gases push down, rocket goes up
- Walking: feet push ground backward, body moves forward
- Book on table: gravity pulls book down, table pushes up",Comprehensive guide to Newton's three laws of motion with examples and applications,"State Newton's laws,Explain inertia and momentum,Apply laws to real-world situations","Inertia,Force,Mass,Acceleration,Action-Reaction pairs",A 2kg object accelerates at 3m/s².
