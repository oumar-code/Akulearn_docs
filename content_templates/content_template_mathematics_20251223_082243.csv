Solving Quadratic Equations by Factorization,Mathematics,Algebra,Quadratic Equations,study_guide,intermediate,WAEC,"# Solving Quadratic Equations by Factorization

## Introduction
Quadratic equations are polynomial equations of degree 2. They can be solved using several methods including factorization.

## Method: Factorization
To solve ax² + bx + c = 0 by factorization:

1. Write the equation in standard form
2. Factor the quadratic expression
3. Set each factor equal to zero
4. Solve for the variable

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Simple Factorization
Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0

**Step 1:** Factor the quadratic
(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0

**Step 2:** Set each factor to zero
x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0

**Step 3:** Solve each equation
x = -2 or x = -3

### Example 2: With Common Factor
Solve 2x² + 8x + 6 = 0

**Step 1:** Divide by 2: x² + 4x + 3 = 0
**Step 2:** Factor: (x + 1)(x + 3) = 0

## Introduction
Probability is the study of chance and uncertainty. It quantifies the likelihood of events occurring and is essential for decision-making in uncertain situations.

## Basic Concepts

### Experiment
A process that produces an outcome. Examples:
- Tossing a coin
- Rolling a die
- Drawing cards from a deck

### Sample Space
Set of all possible outcomes. Denoted by S.

### Event
Subset of the sample space. Can be:
- Simple event: Single outcome
- Compound event: Multiple outcomes
- Impossible event: Empty set
- Certain event: Entire sample space

## Classical Probability

### Definition
P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes

### Assumptions
- All outcomes equally likely
- Finite number of outcomes
- Outcomes mutually exclusive

### Examples
- Coin toss: P(Heads) = 1/2
- Die roll: P(6) = 1/6
- Card draw: P(King) = 4/52 = 1/13

## Addition Rule

### For Mutually Exclusive Events
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)

### For Non-Mutually Exclusive Events
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

### Complementary Events
P(A') = 1 - P(A)

## Multiplication Rule

### Independent Events
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)

### Dependent Events
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

### Conditional Probability
P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)

## Tree Diagrams

## Binomial Probability

### Conditions

- Each trial has 2 outcomes (success/failure)
- Constant probability of success (p)
- Independent trials

### Formula
P(X = r) = ⁿCᵣ pʳ (1-p)ⁿ⁻ʳ

- Symmetric about mean
- Total area under curve = 1
- Defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)

### Standard Normal Distribution

### Tangents and Normals
- Slope of tangent: f'(a)
- Equation of tangent: y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a)
- Normal is perpendicular to tangent

### Maximum and Minimum Values

#### Critical Points
Points where f'(x) = 0 or undefined

#### Second Derivative Test
- If f''(c) > 0: local minimum
- If f''(c) < 0: local maximum
- If f''(c) = 0: inconclusive

### Increasing and Decreasing Functions
- Increasing: f'(x) > 0
- Decreasing: f'(x) < 0
- Constant: f'(x) = 0

## Introduction
Probability is the study of chance and uncertainty. It quantifies the likelihood of events occurring and is essential for decision-making in uncertain situations.

## Basic Concepts

### Experiment
A process that produces an outcome. Examples:
- Tossing a coin
- Rolling a die
- Drawing cards from a deck

### Sample Space
Set of all possible outcomes. Denoted by S.

### Event
Subset of the sample space. Can be:
- Simple event: Single outcome
- Compound event: Multiple outcomes
- Impossible event: Empty set
- Certain event: Entire sample space

## Classical Probability

### Definition
P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes

### Assumptions
- All outcomes equally likely
- Finite number of outcomes
- Outcomes mutually exclusive

### Examples
- Coin toss: P(Heads) = 1/2
- Die roll: P(6) = 1/6
- Card draw: P(King) = 4/52 = 1/13

## Addition Rule

### For Mutually Exclusive Events
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)

### For Non-Mutually Exclusive Events
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

### Complementary Events
P(A') = 1 - P(A)

## Multiplication Rule

### Independent Events
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)

### Dependent Events
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

### Conditional Probability
P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)

## Tree Diagrams
Visual representation of multi-stage experiments showing:
- Branches for choices
- Probabilities on branches
- Outcomes at endpoints

## Permutations and Combinations

### Permutations
Arrangements of objects where order matters.

### Formula
ⁿPᵣ = n! / (n-r)!

### Combinations
Selections of objects where order doesn't matter.

### Formula
ⁿCᵣ = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

## Binomial Probability

### Conditions
- Fixed number of trials (n)
- Each trial has 2 outcomes (success/failure)
- Constant probability of success (p)
- Independent trials

### Formula
P(X = r) = ⁿCᵣ pʳ (1-p)ⁿ⁻ʳ

### Mean and Variance
- Mean: μ = np
- Variance: σ² = np(1-p)

## Normal Distribution

### Properties
- Bell-shaped curve
- Symmetric about mean
- Total area under curve = 1
- Defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)

### Standard Normal Distribution
- Mean = 0, Standard deviation = 1
- Z-scores: z = (x - μ)/σ

### Applications
- Heights and weights
- Test scores
- Measurement errors
- Quality control

## Nigerian Applications

- Crop yield predictions
- Weather forecasting
- Pest control effectiveness
- Harvest timing decisions

### Health
- Disease outbreak probabilities

## Common Mistakes

- Misinterpreting independent vs dependent events
- Incorrect binomial probability calculations
