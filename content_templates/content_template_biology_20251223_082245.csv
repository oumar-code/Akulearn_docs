## Introduction
The cell is the basic unit of life. Understanding cell structure and function is fundamental to biology.

## Cell Theory
1. All living organisms are composed of cells
2. The cell is the basic unit of life
3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells

## Types of Cells

### Prokaryotic Cells

- Examples: Bacteria, Archaea
- Genetic material in nucleoid region

### Eukaryotic Cells
- Membrane-bound nucleus
- Larger size (10-100 μm)
- Examples: Plants, animals, fungi, protists
- Complex internal organization

- Glycoproteins and glycolipids on surface

### Functions
- Selective permeability
- Cell recognition
- Cell signaling
- Protection

### Fluid Mosaic Model
- Membrane is fluid (components can move)

- Proposed by Singer and Nicolson

## Nucleus

### Structure
- Double membrane envelope

## Golgi Apparatus
- Modifies and packages proteins
- Forms lysosomes
- Transports materials
- Produces secretory vesicles

## Lysosomes
- Contain hydrolytic enzymes
- Digest macromolecules
- Recycle cellular components
- Destroy pathogens

## Vacuoles
- Storage organelles
- Maintain turgor pressure (plants)
- Isolate harmful substances
- Store nutrients

## Cell Wall (Plants)
- Made of cellulose
- Provides structural support
- Protects against mechanical damage
- Prevents excessive water uptake

## Chloroplasts (Plants)
- Site of photosynthesis
- Contain chlorophyll
- Double membrane
- Thylakoids and stroma

## Comparison: Plant vs Animal Cells

| Feature | Plant Cell | Animal Cell |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Cell Wall | Present | Absent |
| Chloroplasts | Present | Absent |
| Large Vacuole | Present | Small/absent |
| Centrioles | Absent | Present |
| Shape | Fixed | Irregular |

## Nigerian Context
- Malaria parasite affects red blood cells
- Agricultural research on plant cell structure
- Biotechnology applications in Lagos and Ibadan
- Traditional medicine uses plant cell components

## Microscopy
- Light microscope: 1000x magnification
- Electron microscope: 100,000x magnification
- Scanning vs Transmission electron microscopy

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
- Misidentifying organelles
- Forgetting plant-specific features
- Incorrect membrane structure description

## Practice Questions
1. Compare prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
2. Describe the structure and function of mitochondria
3. Explain the fluid mosaic model
4. What are the differences between rough and smooth ER?

Ecology: Ecosystems and Interactions,Biology,Ecology,Ecosystems,study_guide,intermediate,WAEC,"# Ecology: Ecosystems and Interactions

## Introduction
Ecology is the study of organisms and their interactions with the environment. Ecosystems are communities of living organisms interacting with their physical environment.

## Levels of Ecological Organization

### Individual
- Single organism
- Physiological processes
- Behavioral adaptations

### Population
- Group of same species in area
- Population size and density
- Growth patterns

### Community
- All populations in area
- Interspecific interactions
- Species diversity

### Ecosystem
- Community + abiotic factors
- Energy flow and nutrient cycling
- Trophic levels

### Biosphere
- All ecosystems on Earth
- Global ecological processes

## Components of Ecosystem

### Biotic Components
- Producers (autotrophs)
- Consumers (heterotrophs)
- Decomposers (saprotrophs)

### Abiotic Components
- Light, temperature, water
- Soil, air, minerals
- Topography, climate

## Energy Flow in Ecosystems

### Food Chains
- Linear sequence of organisms
- Transfer of energy
- Trophic levels

### Food Webs
- Complex network of food chains
- More realistic representation
- Energy pathways

### Trophic Levels
1. **Producers**: Green plants, algae
2. **Primary Consumers**: Herbivores
3. **Secondary Consumers**: Carnivores
4. **Tertiary Consumers**: Top carnivores
5. **Decomposers**: Bacteria, fungi

## Ecological Pyramids

### Pyramid of Numbers
- Number of organisms at each level
- Usually pyramid-shaped
- Exceptions: Parasitic food chains

### Pyramid of Biomass
- Dry weight of organisms
- More accurate than numbers
- Always pyramid-shaped

### Pyramid of Energy
- Energy content at each level
- Always pyramid-shaped
- Shows energy loss (10% rule)

## Nutrient Cycling

### Carbon Cycle
- Photosynthesis and respiration
- Combustion and decomposition
- Oceanic absorption

### Nitrogen Cycle
- Nitrogen fixation
- Nitrification and denitrification
- Ammonification

### Water Cycle
- Evaporation and transpiration
- Condensation and precipitation
- Surface and groundwater flow

## Population Ecology

### Population Growth
- **Exponential Growth**: J-shaped curve
- **Logistic Growth**: S-shaped curve
- Carrying capacity

### Population Regulation
- Density-dependent factors
- Density-independent factors
- r and K strategists
