Solving Quadratic Equations by Factorization,Mathematics,Algebra,Quadratic Equations,study_guide,intermediate,WAEC,"# Solving Quadratic Equations by Factorization

## Introduction
Quadratic equations are polynomial equations of degree 2. They can be solved using several methods including factorization.

## Method: Factorization
To solve ax² + bx + c = 0 by factorization:

1. Write the equation in standard form
2. Factor the quadratic expression
3. Set each factor equal to zero
4. Solve for the variable

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Simple Factorization
Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0

**Step 1:** Factor the quadratic
(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0

**Step 2:** Set each factor to zero
x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0

**Step 3:** Solve each equation
x = -2 or x = -3

### Example 2: With Common Factor
Solve 2x² + 8x + 6 = 0

**Step 1:** Divide by 2: x² + 4x + 3 = 0
**Step 2:** Factor: (x + 1)(x + 3) = 0
**Step 3:** x = -1 or x = -3",Factorization method for solving quadratic equations with step-by-step examples,"Solve quadratic equations by factorization,Identify when to use factorization,Apply factorization to real-world problems","Standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0,Zero product property,Factors and roots","x² + 5x + 6 = 0 → (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0 → x = -2, -3","ax² + bx + c = (x + m)(x + n) where m + n = b, mn = c","Forgetting to set factors equal to zero,Ignoring the ± in solutions,Not checking solutions","Solve: x² - 7x + 12 = 0, 2x² + x - 6 = 0, x² + 2x - 8 = 0","Always check your factors by expanding,Look for common factors first,Practice different number combinations",20,"Basic algebra,Linear equations","WAEC Math 2020 Q1,WAEC Math 2021 Q3","algebra,quadratic equations,factorization,mathematics",Mathematics Expert,"WAEC Mathematics Syllabus 2023,Adelodun A.

## The Three Main Ratios

### Sine (sin)
sin θ = Opposite / Hypotenuse

### Cosine (cos)
cos θ = Adjacent / Hypotenuse

### Tangent (tan)
tan θ = Opposite / Adjacent

## Reciprocal Ratios

### Cosecant (cosec)
cosec θ = 1 / sin θ = Hypotenuse / Opposite

### Secant (sec)
sec θ = 1 / cos θ = Hypotenuse / Adjacent

### Cotangent (cot)
cot θ = 1 / tan θ = Adjacent / Opposite

## Important Identities

### Pythagorean Identity
sin²θ + cos²θ = 1

### Quotient Identity
tan θ = sin θ / cos θ

### Reciprocal Identities
cosec θ = 1/sin θ, sec θ = 1/cos θ, cot θ = 1/tan θ
