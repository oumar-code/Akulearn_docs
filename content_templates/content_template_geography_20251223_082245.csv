## Introduction
Weather and climate are fundamental concepts in geography. Weather is the atmospheric conditions at a specific time and place, while climate is the long-term average weather pattern.

## Elements of Weather

### Temperature
- Measure of hotness/coldness
- Measured in Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F)
- Controls evaporation and condensation
- Affects human comfort and activities

### Precipitation
- Water falling from atmosphere
- Types: Rain, snow, hail, sleet, dew
- Measured by rain gauge
- Essential for agriculture

### Humidity
- Amount of water vapor in air
- Relative humidity: Percentage of saturation
- Absolute humidity: Mass of water vapor per unit volume
- Affects comfort and weather patterns

### Wind
- Movement of air from high to low pressure
- Measured by anemometer
- Direction measured by wind vane
- Influences temperature and precipitation

### Atmospheric Pressure
- Weight of air above
- Measured in millibars (mb) or hectopascals (hPa)
- High pressure: Fair weather
- Low pressure: Stormy weather

## Weather Instruments

### Thermometer
- Measures temperature
- Mercury or alcohol based
- Maximum and minimum thermometers

### Barometer
- Measures atmospheric pressure
- Mercury or aneroid types
- Predicts weather changes

### Hygrometer
- Measures humidity
- Wet and dry bulb hygrometer
- Hair hygrometer

### Rain Gauge
- Measures precipitation
- Tipping bucket or funnel types
- Records rainfall amount

## Climate Classification

### Tropical Climate
- High temperatures year-round
- Heavy rainfall
- Located near equator
- Nigeria: Tropical rainforest and savanna

### Temperate Climate
- Four distinct seasons
- Moderate temperatures
- Adequate rainfall
- Found in middle latitudes

### Desert Climate
- Very low precipitation
- Extreme temperature variations
- Located in subtropical regions
- Nigeria: Northern parts (Sahara influence)

### Mediterranean Climate
- Hot, dry summers
- Mild, wet winters
- Found near large water bodies

## Nigerian Climate

### Tropical Rainforest Climate (South)
- Annual rainfall: 2000-3000mm
- Temperature: 25-32°C
- Double maxima rainfall
- High humidity and cloud cover

### Guinea Savanna Climate (Middle Belt)
- Annual rainfall: 1000-1500mm
- Temperature: 24-31°C
- Single rainfall maximum
- Longer dry season

### Sudan Savanna Climate (North)
- Annual rainfall: 500-1000mm
- Temperature: 25-35°C
- Short rainy season
- Long dry season

### Sahel Climate (Extreme North)
- Annual rainfall: <500mm
- Temperature: 20-40°C
- Very short rainy season
- Desertification prone

## Weather Forecasting

### Methods
- Satellite imagery
- Weather radar
- Weather balloons
- Computer models

### Nigerian Weather Services
- Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET)
- Provides weather forecasts
- Issues warnings for severe weather
- Climate data collection

## Climate Change and Nigeria

### Impacts
- Rising temperatures
- Changing rainfall patterns
- Sea level rise (coastal areas)
- Increased extreme weather events

### Adaptation Strategies
- Improved irrigation systems
- Drought-resistant crops
- Climate-smart agriculture
- Coastal protection measures

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing weather and climate
- Incorrect temperature conversions
- Misunderstanding pressure systems
- Forgetting Nigerian climate variations

## Practice Questions
1. Explain the difference between weather and climate
2. Describe the main elements of weather
3. What weather instruments are used to measure temperature?
4. Describe the climate of your local area in Nigeria
5. How does climate change affect Nigeria?
