## Introduction
Demand and supply are fundamental concepts in economics. They determine prices and quantities in markets and explain how markets work.

## Theory of Demand

### Definition
Demand is the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices during a given period of time.

### Law of Demand
- Inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded
- As price increases, quantity demanded decreases (ceteris paribus)
- As price decreases, quantity demanded increases

### Demand Schedule
- Tabular representation of demand
- Shows quantity demanded at different prices

### Demand Curve
- Graphical representation of demand
- Downward sloping curve
- Shows inverse relationship

## Factors Affecting Demand

### Price of the Commodity
- Law of demand applies

### Income of Consumers
- **Normal Goods**: Demand increases with income
- **Inferior Goods**: Demand decreases with income

### Prices of Related Goods
- **Substitute Goods**: Price increase of one increases demand for the other
- **Complementary Goods**: Price increase of one decreases demand for the other

### Tastes and Preferences
- Changes in consumer preferences
- Advertising and marketing
- Cultural factors

### Number of Consumers
- Population growth
- Market size expansion

### Expectation of Future Prices
- If price expected to rise, current demand increases
- If price expected to fall, current demand decreases

## Theory of Supply

### Definition
Supply is the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to offer for sale at various prices during a given period of time.

### Law of Supply
- Direct relationship between price and quantity supplied
- As price increases, quantity supplied increases
- As price decreases, quantity supplied decreases

### Supply Schedule
- Tabular representation of supply
- Shows quantity supplied at different prices

### Supply Curve
- Graphical representation of supply
- Upward sloping curve
- Shows direct relationship

## Factors Affecting Supply

### Price of the Commodity
- Law of supply applies

### Cost of Production
- Input prices (labor, raw materials)
- Technology improvements
- Taxes and subsidies

### Number of Producers
- Entry of new firms increases supply
- Exit of firms decreases supply

### Technology
- Technological improvements increase supply
- Reduce production costs

### Government Policies
- Taxes increase costs, decrease supply
- Subsidies decrease costs, increase supply

### Weather and Natural Conditions
- Important for agricultural products
- Natural disasters affect supply

## Market Equilibrium

### Definition
Equilibrium is the point where demand equals supply.

### Equilibrium Price
- Price at which quantity demanded = quantity supplied
- Also called market-clearing price

### Equilibrium Quantity
- Quantity bought and sold at equilibrium price

### Effects of Changes
- **Increase in Demand**: Price and quantity increase
- **Decrease in Demand**: Price and quantity decrease
- **Increase in Supply**: Price decreases, quantity increases
- **Decrease in Supply**: Price increases, quantity decreases

## Nigerian Economic Applications

### Agricultural Markets
- Cocoa, palm oil, cassava markets
- Seasonal supply variations
- Government intervention through marketing boards

### Petroleum Products
- PMS (petrol), diesel, kerosene
- Government subsidies and pricing
- Supply constraints and distribution

### Foreign Exchange Market
- Naira-dollar exchange rates
- Demand for imports, supply of exports
- Central Bank interventions

### Labor Market
- Supply of skilled labor
- Demand for various professions
- Wage determination

## Price Controls

### Price Ceiling
- Maximum price set by government
- Below equilibrium price
- Leads to shortages
- Examples: Rent controls, essential commodities

### Price Floor
- Minimum price set by government
- Above equilibrium price
- Leads to surpluses
- Examples: Minimum wage, agricultural products

## Elasticity

### Price Elasticity of Demand
- Measures responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes
- Formula: %ΔQd / %ΔP

### Types
- **Elastic**: > 1
- **Inelastic**: < 1
- **Unit Elastic**: = 1

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing movements along vs shifts of curves
- Forgetting ceteris paribus assumption
- Misunderstanding equilibrium changes
- Incorrect elasticity calculations

## Practice Problems
1. Draw a demand curve and explain the law of demand
2. Explain factors that can cause a shift in the demand curve
3. What happens to equilibrium price and quantity when demand increases?
4. Calculate price elasticity of demand given: P=100→80, Q=200→300
5. Explain how price controls work in Nigerian markets
