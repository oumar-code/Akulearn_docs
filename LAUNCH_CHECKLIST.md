## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: Calendly link isn't working?**
A: Copy directly from Calendly dashboard after creating event. Make sure you're signed in.

**Q: LinkedIn post formatting looks weird?**
A: Paste as plain text, then re-add hashtags. Avoid copy/paste from markdown.

**Q: No responses after first 3 posts?**
A: Normal for cold launch. Keep posting consistently for 2-3 weeks. Share in 3-5 communities.

**Q: Kaggle notebook not rendering?**
A: GitHub sometimes needs refresh. Try: clear browser cache → reload.

**Q: Should I post from personal or company account?**
A: Post company content from company account if you have one. Otherwise, use personal. Just be consistent.
