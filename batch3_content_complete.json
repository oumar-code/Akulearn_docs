Bank savings grow in geometric progression (compound interest). Property prices in Lagos increase in arithmetic progression. Civil servant salaries follow predictable sequences. Understanding sequences and series unlocks the mathematics of growth, investment, and planning.\n\n## Part 1: Arithmetic Progression (AP)\n\n### Definition\nAn Arithmetic Progression is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\n\n**Form**: a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ...\n\n**Examples**:\n- 2, 5, 8, 11, ... (first term a=2, common difference d=3)\n- 100, 95, 90, 85, ... (a=100, d=-5)\n\n### Nigerian Example 1: Civil Servant Salary Progression\nA teacher starts at ₦120,000/month with ₦5,000 annual increment.\n\n**Sequence**:\n- Year 1: ₦120,000\n- Year 2: ₦125,000\n- Year 3: ₦130,000\n- Year 4: ₦135,000\n\nThis is AP with a = 120,000 and d = 5,000.\n\n### nth Term of AP\n**Formula**: Tₙ = a + (n-1)d\n\n**Problem**: What is the teacher's salary in year 10?\n- Tₙ = 120,000 + (10-1) × 5,000\n- T₁₀ = 120,000 + 45,000 = ₦165,000\n\n**WAEC Tip**: Always write the formula before substituting values!\n\n### Sum of n Terms of AP\n**Formula**: Sₙ = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d] OR Sₙ = n/2 (first + last)\n\n**Worked Example 1: Total Salary Over 10 Years**\nHow much total salary does the teacher earn in 10 years?\n\n**Solution**:\n- First term: a = 120,000\n- Last term (year 10): T₁₀ = 165,000\n- Number of terms: n = 10\n\n**Using formula**:\n- S₁₀ = 10/2 (120,000 + 165,000)\n- S₁₀ = 5 × 285,000\n- **S₁₀ = ₦1,425,000**\n\n**Meaning**: Total earnings over 10 years = ₦1.425 million\n\n## Part 2: Geometric Progression (GP)\n\n### Definition\nA Geometric Progression is a sequence where the ratio between consecutive terms is constant.\n\n**Form**: a, ar, ar², ar³, ...\n\n**Examples**:\n- 2, 6, 18, 54, ... (a=2, r=3)\n- 100, 50, 25, 12.5, ... (a=100, r=0.5)\n\n### Nigerian Example 2: Bank Compound Interest\n₦100,000 deposited in GTBank at 10% annual interest.\n\n**Balance after each year**:\n- Year 0: ₦100,000\n- Year 1: ₦100,000 × 1.1 = ₦110,000\n- Year 2: ₦110,000 × 1.1 = ₦121,000\n- Year 3: ₦133,100\n- Year 4: ₦146,410\n\n**This is GP** with a = 100,000 and r = 1.1\n\n### nth Term of GP\n**Formula**: Tₙ = ar^(n-1)\n\n**Problem**: How much money after 5 years?\n- T₅ = 100,000 × (1.1)⁴\n- T₅ = 100,000 × 1.4641\n- T₅ = **₦146,410**\n\n### Sum of n Terms of GP\n**Formula**: Sₙ = a(r^n - 1)/(r - 1) [when r ≠ 1]\n\n**Worked Example 2: Total Interest Earned**\nWhat is the total amount in bank account after 5 years?\n\n**Solution**:\n- a = 100,000\n- r = 1.1\n- n = 5\n\n**Using formula**:\n- S₅ = 100,000(1.1⁵ - 1)/(1.1 - 1)\n- S₅ = 100,000(1.6105 - 1)/0.1\n- S₅ = 100,000(0.6105)/0.1\n- S₅ = 100,000 × 6.105\n- **S₅ = ₦610,500** (total amount after 5 years)\n\n**Interest earned** = 610,500 - 100,000 × 5 = ₦110,500\n\n## Part 3: Sum to Infinity (GP Only)\n\n### When -1 < r < 1\nThe series approaches a finite limit.\n\n**Formula**: S∞ = a/(1-r)\n\n**Worked Example 3: Recurring Decimal**\nThe decimal 0.333... = 1/3 can be written as a GP.\n\n**0.333...** = 0.3 + 0.03 + 0.003 + ...\n- a = 0.3\n- r = 0.1\n- S∞ = 0.3/(1-0.1) = 0.3/0.9 = **1/3** ✓\n\n## Part 4: Real Nigerian Applications\n\n### Property Prices in Lagos\nLekki property values appreciate 5% annually (GP with r = 1.05).\n\nStarting price: ₦10,000,000 in 2020.\n\n**Price by year**:\n- 2020: ₦10,000,000\n- 2022: ₦10,000,000 × (1.05)² = ₦11,025,000\n- 2025: ₦10,000,000 × (1.05)⁵ = ₦12,762,815\n\n**Question**: After 10 years, value = ?\n- T₁₁ = 10,000,000 × (1.05)¹⁰ = ₦16,288,946\n\n### MTN Subscriber Growth\nMTN Nigeria adds 2 million subscribers annually (AP).\n\n**Year 1**: 60 million subscribers\n**Year 2**: 62 million\n**Year 3**: 64 million\n\n**Total subscribers by year 5**:\n- a = 60 million\n- d = 2 million\n- n = 5\n- S₅ = 5/2[2(60) + (5-1)×2] = 2.5[120 + 8] = **320 million subscriber-years**\n\n### Dangote Cement Distribution\nProduction increases 15% annually (GP with r = 1.15).\n\n**Starting production**: 5 million tonnes in 2020.\n\n**Projected for 2026**:\n- T₇ = 5 × (1.15)⁶ = 5 × 2.313 = **11.57 million tonnes**\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Identify the sequence**: Look for constant difference (AP) or constant ratio (GP)\n2. **Write known values**: a (first term), d or r, n (number of terms)\n3. **Choose correct formula**: AP or GP sum formula\n4. **Show substitution**: Write values into formula before calculating\n5. **State units**: Always include ₦, tonnes, years, etc.\n6. **Check reasonableness**: Does answer make sense in context?\n7. **Practice with negative terms**: Some sequences decrease\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: A trader's monthly profit increases from ₦50,000 by ₦10,000 each month. Find total profit in 12 months.\n\n**Problem 2**: UBA offers 8% compound interest on savings. If ₦500,000 is invested, find amount after 3 years.\n\n**Problem 3**: An AP has first term 5 and common difference 3. Find the sum of first 20 terms.\n\n**Problem 4**: A GP has first term 2 and common ratio 3. Find the 6th term.\n\n## Key Formulas\n\n- **AP nth term**: Tₙ = a + (n-1)d\n- **AP sum**: Sₙ = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]\n- **GP nth term**: Tₙ = ar^(n-1)\n- **GP sum**: Sₙ = a(r^n - 1)/(r - 1)\n- **GP infinite sum**: S∞ = a/(1-r) [when |r| < 1]\n\n## Nigerian Context Importance\n\nUnderstanding sequences helps with:\n- **Banking**: Calculate investment returns and loan repayment\n- **Business**: Project growth and sales forecasts\n- **Property**: Predict appreciation and investment value\n- **Demographics**: Plan for population changes\n- **Salary**: Understand career earning potential\n- **Telecommunications**: Analyze subscriber growth\n\nThis knowledge directly applies to Nigerian financial planning and business decisions!\n",

Food cooks at precise temperatures, vaccines need cold storage, and electricity consumption depends on climate. Understanding temperature and heat is essential for daily life in Nigeria.\n\n## Part 1: Temperature Scales\n\n### Celsius Scale\nMost common in Nigeria. Based on water freezing (0°C) and boiling (100°C) at sea level.\n\n**Nigerian Temperature Examples**:\n- Lagos average: 27°C (warm year-round)\n- Jos Plateau: 20°C (cooler highland)\n- Sokoto dry season: 42°C (very hot)\n- Cool room: 16°C\n- Normal body: 37°C\n- Fever: 39-40°C\n\n### Fahrenheit Scale\nUsed in some medical contexts and old British instruments.\n\n**Conversion**:\n- F = 9/5 × C + 32\n- C = 5/9 × (F - 32)\n\n**Worked Example 1: Lagos Temperature Conversion**\nLagos average is 27°C. Convert to Fahrenheit.\n- F = 9/5 × 27 + 32\n- F = 48.6 + 32\n- **F = 80.6°F** (warm and comfortable)\n\n### Kelvin Scale\nAbsolute temperature scale. K = C + 273 (or C + 273.15 precisely)\n\n**Nigerian temperatures in Kelvin**:\n- Lagos 27°C = 300 K\n- Jos 20°C = 293 K\n- Sokoto 42°C = 315 K\n\n**WAEC Tip**: Always convert to Kelvin for gas law calculations!\n\n## Part 2: Heat Capacity and Specific Heat Capacity\n\n### Heat Capacity (C)\nEnergy needed to raise 1 object by 1°C.\n\n**Formula**: Q = C × ΔT\n\nwhere:\n- Q = heat energy (joules)\n- C = heat capacity (J/°C)\n- ΔT = temperature change (°C)\n\n### Specific Heat Capacity (c)\nEnergy needed to raise 1 kg of substance by 1°C.\n\n**Formula**: Q = m × c × ΔT\n\n**Worked Example 2: Heating Nigerian Soup**\nA pot of vegetable soup (5 kg) needs heating from 25°C to 95°C.\n\n**Given**:\n- Mass m = 5 kg\n- Temperature change: ΔT = 95 - 25 = 70°C\n- Specific heat of water (main component): c = 4,200 J/kg°C\n\n**Solution**:\n- Q = m × c × ΔT\n- Q = 5 × 4,200 × 70\n- Q = 1,470,000 J = **1.47 MJ**\n\n**Meaning**: Need 1.47 million joules of energy to heat the soup.\n\n**Nigerian context**: A gas stove releases ~30 MJ per hour, so this takes ~3 minutes.\n\n### Specific Heat Values (Common Nigerian Materials)\n| Material | Specific Heat (J/kg°C) |\n|----------|----------------------|\n| Water | 4,200 |\n| Cooking oil | 2,000 |\n| Sand (Sahara) | 800 |\n| Iron (cookware) | 450 |\n| Aluminum | 900 |\n\n## Part 3: Latent Heat\n\n### Latent Heat of Fusion (Melting)\nEnergy needed to melt solid without temperature change.\n\n**Formula**: Q = m × Lf\n\n- Ice: Lf = 334,000 J/kg\n- Energy to melt 1 kg ice = 334 kJ\n\n### Latent Heat of Vaporization (Boiling)\nEnergy needed to convert liquid to gas without temperature change.\n\n**Formula**: Q = m × Lv\n\n- Water: Lv = 2,260,000 J/kg (2.26 MJ)\n- Energy to boil 1 kg water = 2,260 kJ\n\n**Worked Example 3: Boiling Water for Pap**\nHeating 2 kg water from 25°C to boiling (100°C), then completely boiling it.\n\n**Step 1 - Heating**:\n- Q₁ = m × c × ΔT\n- Q₁ = 2 × 4,200 × 75\n- Q₁ = 630,000 J\n\n**Step 2 - Boiling (vaporization)**:\n- Q₂ = m × Lv\n- Q₂ = 2 × 2,260,000\n- Q₂ = 4,520,000 J\n\n**Total energy**:\n- Q_total = 630,000 + 4,520,000 = **5,150,000 J = 5.15 MJ**\n\n**Meaning**: Mostly goes to vaporization, not heating!\n\n## Part 4: Heat Transfer Methods\n\n### Conduction\nDirect transfer through material (no movement).\n\n**Nigerian Example**: Metal pot conducting heat to food inside.\n- Aluminum pot conducts heat quickly (high conductivity)\n- Traditional clay pots conduct slowly\n\n**Application**: Choose materials wisely for cooking efficiency!\n\n### Convection\nTransfer through movement of liquid/gas.\n\n**Nigerian Example**: Hot water in soup rising, cold sinking.\n- Creates circular motion\n- Distributes heat throughout\n\n**Application**: Stir soup for even heating (stronger convection).\n\n### Radiation\nTransfer through electromagnetic waves (no contact needed).\n\n**Nigerian Example**: Nigerian sun warming Lagos without touching.\n- Infrared radiation heats skin, buildings\n- Solar panels use this to generate electricity (Kaduna installations)\n\n## Part 5: Real Nigerian Heat Applications\n\n### Air Conditioning Load (Lagos)\nTo keep room at 22°C when outside is 32°C:\n\n**Heat entering** ≈ Building surface area × Temperature difference × U-value\n\nModern Lagos office building (500 m²) requires:\n- Cooling capacity: ~60 kW\n- Cost: ₦50,000/month electricity (NEPA rate)\n\n### Cooking Efficiency\nGas stove (~10 kW) vs electric kettle (2 kW):\n- **Gas**: Heats water in 5 minutes (efficient, cheaper)\n- **Electric**: Heats water in 10 minutes (less efficient, more expensive)\n\n**Cost comparison**:\n- Gas: 1 liter water = ₦50 cost\n- Electricity: 1 liter water = ₦120 cost (2.4× more expensive)\n\n### Vaccine Cold Chain\nPfizer vaccine storage: 2-8°C required.\n\n**Cooling needed**: Remove heat to maintain low temperature.\n- Nigerian cold store in Lagos: ₦5M system\n- Running cost: ₦100,000/month electricity\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Check temperature units**: Problem might be in K, not °C\n2. **Include latent heat**: Don't forget vaporization/fusion energy\n3. **Show all steps**: Heating then boiling (two separate processes)\n4. **State formula first**: Write Q = mc∆T before substituting\n5. **Use correct c value**: Different materials have different specific heat\n6. **Units matter**: Answer in joules, always\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: Convert 40°C to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.\n\n**Problem 2**: How much energy to heat 10 kg iron from 20°C to 100°C? (c = 450 J/kg°C)\n\n**Problem 3**: How much energy to melt 5 kg ice at 0°C? (Lf = 334,000 J/kg)\n\n**Problem 4**: A Lagos building loses 100 kJ heat per minute. How long for 5 MJ loss?\n\n## Key Equations\n\n- **Conversion**: F = 9/5C + 32, K = C + 273\n- **Heat capacity**: Q = mc∆T\n- **Latent heat**: Q = mL\n- **Total thermal energy**: Q_total = mc∆T + mL\n\n## Nigerian Context Importance\n\nTemperature and heat knowledge helps with:\n- **Cooking**: Efficient food preparation (gas vs electric)\n- **Climate**: Adapt to Lagos heat or Jos coolness\n- **Health**: Fever understanding, vaccine storage\n- **Business**: AC costs, refrigeration, solar thermal\n- **Energy**: Electricity consumption, efficiency improvements\n- **Construction**: Thermal insulation design\n\nThis knowledge makes Nigerian daily life more efficient and economical!\n",

NEPA bills vary with electricity consumed. Worker productivity varies with rest time. Fertilizer yield varies with rainfall and nutrients. Understanding variation unlocks prediction and planning in Nigerian life.\n\n## Part 1: Direct Variation\n\n### Definition\ny varies directly with x means: y = kx\n\nwhere k is the constant of variation.\n\n**Property**: When x increases, y increases proportionally.\n\n### Nigerian Example 1: Taxi Fares in Lagos\nTypical rate: ₦100 per kilometer\n\n**Relationship**: Fare = 100 × Distance\n\n**Worked Example**:\n- 5 km trip costs: Fare = 100 × 5 = ₦500\n- 15 km trip costs: Fare = 100 × 15 = ₦1,500\n- 25 km trip costs: Fare = 100 × 25 = ₦2,500\n\n**Pattern**: Fare varies directly with distance (k = 100)\n\n### Finding the Constant\n**If y varies directly with x**, and y = 20 when x = 4:\n\n- y = kx\n- 20 = k(4)\n- k = 5\n\n**So equation is y = 5x**\n\n## Part 2: Inverse Variation\n\n### Definition\ny varies inversely with x means: y = k/x\n\nwhere k is the constant.\n\n**Property**: When x increases, y decreases.\n\n### Nigerian Example 2: Workers and Project Time\nBuilding a 100 m² house requires 1,000 man-hours of work.\n\n**If 10 workers work on the project**:\n- Time = 1,000/10 = 100 hours each\n- Total time: 100 hours\n\n**If 20 workers work on project**:\n- Time = 1,000/20 = 50 hours each\n- Total time: 50 hours\n\n**Pattern**: More workers → less time (inverse variation, k = 1,000)\n\n### Worked Example: Supplies Management\nA delivery driver uses fuel inversely proportional to remaining supplies. With 500 liters fuel, can cover 2,000 km (k = 500 × 2,000 = 1,000,000).\n\n**How far with 250 liters**?\n- Distance = 1,000,000/250\n- Distance = **4,000 km** ✓\n\n## Part 3: Joint Variation\n\n### Definition\nz varies jointly with x and y means: z = kxy\n\n**Property**: z changes with changes in both x and y.\n\n### Nigerian Example 3: Farm Harvest\nCrop yield depends on fertilizer AND rainfall.\n\n**Formula**: Yield = k × Fertilizer × Rainfall\n\nIf k = 50 (kg yield per unit fertilizer per unit rainfall):\n- With 100 units fertilizer and 500 mm rainfall:\n  Yield = 50 × 100 × 500 = 2,500,000 kg\n\n- With 100 units fertilizer and 300 mm rainfall (less rain):\n  Yield = 50 × 100 × 300 = 1,500,000 kg\n\n**Both factors matter for maximum yield**\n\n## Part 4: Partial Variation\n\n### Definition\ny partially varies with x when: y = a + kx\n\n**Property**: y has a fixed component (a) plus variable component (kx)\n\n### Nigerian Example 4: NEPA Electricity Billing\nBill = Base fee + Usage charge\nBill = 1,000 + 68 × kWh\n\n**If use 500 kWh**:\n- Bill = 1,000 + 68 × 500\n- Bill = 1,000 + 34,000\n- **Bill = ₦35,000**\n\n**If use 200 kWh**:\n- Bill = 1,000 + 68 × 200\n- Bill = 1,000 + 13,600\n- **Bill = ₦14,600**\n\n**Pattern**: Even with 0 kWh, you pay ₦1,000 base fee\n\n## Part 5: Complex Variation Problems\n\n### Worked Example 1: Transport Cost Analysis\nA hauling company charges: Cost = Base + (Distance × Rate) + (Weight × Factor)\n\n**Cost = 5,000 + 100D + 50W**\n\nwhere D = distance (km), W = weight (tonnes)\n\n**For 100 km trip with 5 tonnes**:\n- Cost = 5,000 + 100(100) + 50(5)\n- Cost = 5,000 + 10,000 + 250\n- **Cost = ₦15,250**\n\n### Worked Example 2: Dangote Cement Production\nProduction depends on workers (W) and machines (M):\n\n**Production = 10 × W × M**\n\n(10 bags per worker-machine unit per day)\n\n**With 50 workers and 10 machines**:\n- Production = 10 × 50 × 10 = 5,000 bags/day\n\n**To increase to 10,000 bags/day**, double either:\n- Option A: 100 workers + 10 machines\n- Option B: 50 workers + 20 machines\n\n## Part 6: Real Nigerian Applications\n\n### Market Trading\nPrice inversely varies with abundance:\n- When tomatoes abundant, price low (₦50/kg)\n- When tomatoes scarce, price high (₦300/kg)\n- **Equation**: Price × Quantity = constant\n\n### Manufacturing\nOutput directly varies with:\n- Number of machines (more machines = more output)\n- Worker skill (trained workers = more output)\n- **Formula**: Output = k × Machines × Skill level\n\n### Transportation Network\nDelivery time partially varies:\n- **Time = Fixed + Distance/Speed**\n- Fixed time: Vehicle prep, paperwork (1 hour)\n- Variable time: Distance/Speed\n\n**Lagos to Ibadan (120 km, average 60 km/h)**:\n- Time = 1 + 120/60 = 1 + 2 = 3 hours\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Identify variation type**: Read problem carefully (direct, inverse, or joint)\n2. **Find constant first**: Use given values to calculate k\n3. **Write equation clearly**: State y = kx before solving\n4. **Substitute completely**: Replace all variables with numbers\n5. **Check units**: Include units in final answer\n6. **Reasonableness test**: Does answer make sense?\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: y varies directly with x. If y = 30 when x = 6, find y when x = 10.\n\n**Problem 2**: m varies inversely with n. If m = 20 when n = 5, find m when n = 2.\n\n**Problem 3**: z varies jointly with x and y. If z = 60 when x = 3 and y = 4, find z when x = 2 and y = 5.\n\n**Problem 4**: Monthly rent = ₦50,000 + ₦500/m² × area. Find rent for 100 m² apartment.\n\n## Key Formulas\n\n- **Direct**: y = kx\n- **Inverse**: y = k/x\n- **Joint**: z = kxy\n- **Partial**: y = a + kx\n\n## Nigerian Context Importance\n\nVariation helps predict and plan:\n- **Transportation**: Calculate fares, delivery times\n- **Commerce**: Price-supply relationships, profit margins\n- **Manufacturing**: Production planning with resources\n- **Agriculture**: Yield predictions with inputs\n- **Utilities**: Calculate bills (NEPA, water, internet)\n- **Business**: Cost analysis, pricing strategies\n\nThis mathematical tool directly applies to Nigerian daily commerce and planning!\n",

Using small triangle, we measure:\n\n**Small triangle**:\n- Height of stick: 2 m\n- Shadow: 1.5 m\n\n**Large triangle**:\n- Aso Rock shadow: 300 m\n- Height: ?\n\n**Since triangles are similar**:\n- 2/1.5 = Height/300\n- Height = 2 × 300/1.5\n- Height = 600/1.5\n- **Height = 400 m**\n\n(Note: Actual Aso Rock height is 256 m, accounting for angle differences)\n\n## Part 4: Pythagoras Theorem\n\n### Formula\nFor right triangle: **a² + b² = c²**\n\nwhere c is hypotenuse (longest side).\n\n### Nigerian Example 3: Land Plot Measurement\nA triangular Lagos property plot:\n- Two sides: 80 m and 60 m\n- These are perpendicular (right angle between them)\n- Third side (diagonal): ?\n\n**Solution**:\n- a² + b² = c²\n- 80² + 60² = c²\n- 6,400 + 3,600 = c²\n- 10,000 = c²\n- c = **100 m**\n\n**Common Pythagorean triples in Nigeria**:\n- 3-4-5 (scaling: 30-40-50, 60-80-100)\n- 5-12-13\n- 8-15-17\n\n### Worked Example: Niger Bridge Measurement\nA bridge support triangle:\n- Height: 50 m\n- Base: 120 m\n- Slant length: ?\n\n**Solution**:\n- 50² + 120² = c²\n- 2,500 + 14,400 = c²\n- 16,900 = c²\n- c = **130 m**\n\n## Part 5: Congruent Triangles\n\n### Conditions for Congruence\n1. **SSS** (Side-Side-Side): All three sides equal\n2. **SAS** (Side-Angle-Side): Two sides and included angle equal\n3. **ASA** (Angle-Side-Angle): Two angles and included side equal\n4. **RHS** (Right-Hypotenuse-Side): Right angle, hypotenuse, and one side equal\n\n### Nigerian Example 4: Identical Roof Trusses\nTwo roof trusses must be congruent:\n- First truss: sides 5 m, 6 m, 7 m\n- Second truss: sides 5 m, 6 m, 7 m\n\n**By SSS**: Trusses are congruent ✓ (identical shapes, sizes)\n\n## Part 6: Real Nigerian Applications\n\n### Land Surveying\nProperty boundaries often use triangulation:\n- Surveyor measures baseline (100 m)\n- Measures angles to boundary corners (45° and 75°)\n- Calculates property perimeter and area\n\n### Construction\nRoof trusses use 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangles:\n- **45-45-90**: Isosceles, sides ratio 1:1:√2\n- **30-60-90**: Sides ratio 1:√3:2\n\n### Architecture\nNigerian traditional patterns use:\n- Equilateral triangles (Igbo crafts)\n- Isosceles triangles (Hausa designs)\n- Right triangles (building foundations)\n\n## WAEC Exam Tips\n\n1. **Draw diagrams**: Always sketch the triangle first\n2. **Label clearly**: Mark all angles and sides\n3. **State theorem**: Write \"By Pythagoras theorem...\" before using\n4. **Check angle sum**: Verify angles add to 180°\n5. **Similar triangles**: Establish correspondence clearly\n6. **Units matter**: Include m, cm, degrees in answer\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Problem 1**: Pentagon (5 sides) interior angle sum = ?\n\n**Problem 2**: Right triangle has sides 3 cm and 4 cm. Hypotenuse = ?\n\n**Problem 3**: Two similar triangles have corresponding sides 4 cm and 6 cm. If first triangle's perimeter is 12 cm, find second triangle's perimeter.\n\n**Problem 4**: Triangle angles are x, 2x, and 3x. Find x.\n\n## Key Formulas\n\n- **Polygon angle sum**: (n-2) × 180°\n- **Exterior angle sum**: 360°\n- **Triangle angle sum**: 180°\n- **Pythagoras**: a² + b² = c²\n\n## Nigerian Context Importance\n\nTriangle geometry applies to:\n- **Construction**: Building design, roof truss angles\n- **Surveying**: Property boundary measurement\n- **Engineering**: Bridge support structures\n- **Land measurement**: Triangulation for area calculation\n- **Architecture**: Traditional pattern design\n- **Arts**: Textile and craft geometric designs\n\nThis foundational geometry enables accurate Nigerian construction and measurement!\n",
