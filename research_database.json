    "authors": ["Dr. Adebayo Adeolu", "Prof. Fatima Bello"],
    "publication": "Journal of African Environmental Studies",
    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "This study examines the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity in Nigeria, focusing on maize and cassava yields in Northern and Southern regions. Using historical climate data and crop yield statistics from 1990-2020, the research finds a 15-20% decline in yields attributed to changing rainfall patterns and rising temperatures.",

    "curriculum_relevance": "Geography SS3, Agricultural Science SS2-SS3",
    "simplified_summary": "Climate change is making farming harder in Nigeria. Farmers are getting less rain in some areas and more heat, which reduces how much maize and cassava they can grow. The study shows yields dropping by 15-20% over 30 years.",
    "methodology": "Longitudinal analysis of climate data from Nigerian Meteorological Agency and agricultural statistics from FAO and NBS. Used statistical regression to correlate temperature/rainfall changes with crop productivity.",
    "key_findings": [
      "Northern Nigeria experiencing more frequent droughts",
      "Southern regions seeing increased flooding",
      "Maize yields most affected, cassava more resilient",
